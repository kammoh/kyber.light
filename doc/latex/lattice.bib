  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography is the generic term for constructions of cryptographic primitives that involve lattices, either in the construction itself or in the security proof. Lattice-based constructions are currently important candidates for post-quantum cryptography.  Unlike more widely used and known public-key schemes such as the RSA, Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic-Curve cryptosystems, which are easily attacked by a quantum computer, some lattice-based constructions appear to be resistant to attack by both classical and quantum computers. Furthermore, many lattice-based constructions are known to be secure under the assumption that certain well-studied computational lattice problems cannot be solved efficiently.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing steadily erode computer security at its foundation, and call for fundamental innovations to strengthen current
practices in computer security, specifically in applied cryptography, from theory to standardization to actual implementations. At
the same time, the emergence of new computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, software defined networks and Internet of
Everything, demands devices to adopt an increasing number of security standards - with a diverse set of cryptographic primitives.
This in turn calls for innovations in security beyond the foundational aspects, down to the actual design and deployment of such
primitives and protocols while satisfying conflicting design constraints such as latency, compactness, and energy efficiency.
The advent of Quantum computing threatens to break many classical cryptographic schemes, leading to innovations in public key
cryptography that focus on post-quantum cryptography primitives and their protocols that are resistant to quantum computing threats.
In particular, lattice-based cryptography is a promising post-quantum cryptography family, both in terms of foundational properties,
as well as its application to both traditional and emerging security problems such as encryption (asymmetric, but also symmetric),
digital signature, key exchange, homomorphic encryption etc. While such techniques provide guarantees in theory, their realization on
contemporary computing platforms requires careful design choices and tradeoffs to manage both the diversity of computing platforms
(e.g., high-performance to resource constrained), as well as agility for deployment in the face of emerging and changing standards.
In this work we survey trends in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some fundamental recent proposals for the use of lattices in
computer security, challenges for their implementation in software and hardware, and emerging needs for their adoption.},

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography has gained credence recently as a replacement for current public-key cryptosystems, due to its quantum-resilience, versatility, and relatively low key sizes. To date, encryption based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem has only been investigated from an ideal lattice standpoint, due to its computation and size efficiencies. However, a thorough investigation of standard lattices in practice has yet to be considered. Standard lattices may be preferred to ideal lattices due to their stronger security assumptions and less restrictive parameter selection process. In this paper, an area-optimised hardware architecture of a standard lattice-based cryptographic scheme is proposed. The design is implemented on a FPGA and it is found that both encryption and decryption fit comfortably on a Spartan-6 FPGA. This is the first hardware architecture for standard lattice-based cryptography reported in the literature to date, and thus is a benchmark for future implementations. Additionally, a revised discrete Gaussian sampler is proposed which is the fastest of its type to date, and also is the first to investigate the cost savings of implementing with λ/2-bits of precision. Performance results are promising compared to the hardware designs of the equivalent ring-LWE scheme, which in addition to providing stronger security proofs; generate 1272 encryptions per second and 4395 decryptions per second.},

The proposed hardware architectures reduce slice usage, number of utilized memory blocks and total memory accesses by using a simplified address generation, improved memory organization and on-the-fly operand generations.

So far it is known for solid security reductions but implementations of specific instances have often been reported to be too complex beyond any practicability. In this work, we present an efficient and scalable micro-code engine for Ring-LWE encryption that combines polynomial multiplication based on the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), polynomial addition, subtraction, and Gaussian sampling in a single unit. This unit can encrypt and decrypt a block in 26.19 µs and 16.80 µs on a Virtex-6 LX75T FPGA, respectively – at moderate resource requirements of about 1506 slices and a few block RAMs. Additionally, we provide solutions for several practical issues with Ring-LWE encryption, including the reduction of ciphertext expansion, error rate and constant-time operation. We hope that this contribution helps to pave the way for the deployment of ideal lattice-based encryption in future real-world systems.},

  doi = {10.1109/ISCAS.2015.7168763},
  abstract = {In this paper, we present the implementation of a multi-mode crypto-coprocessor, which can support three different public-key cryptography (PKC) engines (NTRU, TTS, Pairing) used in post-quantum and identity-based cryptosystems. The PKC-based security protocols are more energy-efficient because they usually require less communication overhead than symmetric-key-based counterparts. In this work, we propose the first-of-its-kind tri-mode PKC coprocessor for secured data transmission in Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. For the purpose of low energy consumption, the crypto-coprocessor incorporates three design features, including 1) specialized instruction set for the multi-mode cryptosystems, 2) a highly parallel arithmetic unit for cryptographic kernel operations, and 3) a smart scheduling unit with intelligent control mechanism. By utilizing the parallel arithmetic unit, the proposed crypto-coprocessor can achieve about 50\% speed up. Meanwhile, the smart scheduling unit can save up to 18\% of the total latency. The crypto-coprocessor was implemented with AHB interface in TSMC 90nm CMOS technology, and the die size is only 1.96 mm\textsuperscript{2}. Furthermore, our chip is integrated with an ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) platform for functional verification.},

As a consequence, the appearance of quantum computers or algorithmic advances on these problems may lead to the unpleasant situation that a large number of today's schemes will most likely need to be replaced with more secure alternatives. In this work we present such an alternative-an efficient signature scheme whose security is derived from the hardness of lattice problems. It is based on recent theoretical advances in lattice-based cryptography and is highly optimized for practicability and use in embedded systems. The public and secret keys are roughly 1.5 kB and 0.3 kB long, while the signature size is approximately 1.1 kB for a security level of around 80 bits. We provide implementation results on reconfigurable hardware (Spartan/Virtex-6) and demonstrate that the scheme is scalable, has low area consumption, and even outperforms classical schemes.},

These optimization techniques reduce both the cycle and memory requirements. Finally, we also propose an optimization of the ring-LWE encryption system that reduces the number of NTT operations from ﬁve to four resulting in a 20\% speed-up. We use these computational optimizations along with several architectural optimizations to design an instruction-set ring-LWE cryptoprocessor. For dimension 256, our processor performs encryption/decryption operations in 20/9 µs on a Virtex 6 FPGA and only requires 1349 LUTs, 860 FFs, 1 DSP-MULT and 2 BRAMs. Similarly for dimension 512, the processor takes 48/21 µs for performing encryption/decryption operations and only requires 1536 LUTs, 953 FFs, 1 DSP-MULT and 3 BRAMs. Our processors are therefore more than three times smaller than the current state of the art hardware implementations, whilst running somewhat faster.},

In order to reduce the cost of bit-reverse operation, a optimization technique is introduced to perform it on-the-fly. We also present a technique to improve the utilization rate of the butterfly operator. Moreover, the cancellation lemma is exploited to reduce the required ROM storage. Based on these optimizations, we present a versatile pipelined polynomial multiplication architecture, which takes around (n lg n + 1.5n) clock cycles to calculate the product of two n-degree polynomials. Experimental results on a Spartan-6 FPGA show that our polynomial multiplier achieves a speedup of 2.04 on average and consumes less hardware resources when compared with the state of art of efficient implementation.},

At the same time, the emergence of new computing paradigms, such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Everything, demand that innovations in security extend beyond their foundational aspects, to the actual design and deployment of these primitives and protocols while satisfying emerging design constraints such as latency, compactness, energy efficiency, and agility. While many alternatives have been proposed for symmetric key cryptography and related protocols (e.g., lightweight ciphers and authenticated encryption), the alternatives for public key cryptography are limited to post-quantum cryptography primitives and their protocols. In particular, lattice-based cryptography is a promising candidate, both in terms of foundational properties, as well as its application to traditional security problems such as key exchange, digital signature, and encryption/decryption.

  abstract = {This paper presents an FPGA implementation of the Niederreiter cryptosystem using binary Goppa codes, including modules for encryption, decryption, and key generation. We improve over previous implementations in terms of efficiency (time-area product and raw performance) and security level. Our implementation is constant time in order to protect against timing side-channel analysis. The design is fully parameterized, using code-generation scripts, in order to support a wide range of parameter choices for security, including binary field size, the degree of the Goppa polynomial, and the code length. The parameterized design allows us to choose design parameters for time-area trade-offs in order to support a wide variety of applications ranging from smart cards to server accelerators. For parameters that are considered to provide “128-bit post-quantum security”, our time-optimized implementation requires 966,400 cycles for the generation of both public and private portions of a key and 14,291 cycles to decrypt a ciphertext. The time-optimized design uses only 121,806 ALMs (52\% of the available logic) and 961 RAM blocks (38\% of the available memory), and results in a design that runs at about 250 MHz on a medium-size Stratix V FPGA.},

  abstract = {Ciphertext indistinguishability is a property of many encryption schemes. Intuitively, if a cryptosystem possesses the property of indistinguishability, then an adversary will be unable to distinguish pairs of ciphertexts based on the message they encrypt. The property of indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is considered a basic requirement for most provably secure public key cryptosystems, though some schemes also provide indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. Indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is equivalent to the property of semantic security, and many cryptographic proofs use these definitions interchangeably.
A cryptosystem is considered secure in terms of indistinguishability if no adversary, given an encryption of a message randomly chosen from a two-element message space determined by the adversary, can identify the message choice with probability significantly better than that of random guessing (\mbox{}1⁄2). If any adversary can succeed in distinguishing the chosen ciphertext with a probability significantly greater than \mbox{}1⁄2, then this adversary is considered to have an "advantage" in distinguishing the ciphertext, and the scheme is not considered secure in terms of indistinguishability. This definition encompasses the notion that in a secure scheme, the adversary should learn no information from seeing a ciphertext. Therefore, the adversary should be able to do no better than if it guessed randomly.},

This work helps in assessing the practicality of lattice-based encryption. For the software implementation, we give a comparison between a matrix and polynomial based variant of the LWE scheme. This module includes multiplication in polynomial rings using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In order to implement lattice-based cryptography in an efficient way, it is crucial to apply the systems over polynomial rings. FFT speeds up multiplication in polynomial rings, which is the most critical operation in lattice-based cryptography, from quadratic to quasi-linear runtime. For the hardware variant, we show how this fundamental building block of lattice-based cryptography can be implemented and evaluated in terms of performance. A second important component for lattice-based cryptosystems is the sampling from discrete Gaussian distributions. We examine three different variants for sampling Gaussian distributed integers, namely rejection sampling, a rounding based approach, and a look-up table based approach in hardware.},

Our implementation supports two representative parameter sets, ees1087ep1 and ees1499ep1, optimized for speed, which provide security levels of 192 and 256 bits, respectively. Our implementation follows an earlier proposed Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Hardware Application Programming Interface (API), which facilitates its fair comparison with implementations of other PQC schemes, especially those submitted for consideration in the NIST PQC standardization process. The paper contains the detailed flow and block diagrams, timing analysis, as well as results in terms of latency (in clock cycles), maximum clock frequency, and resource utilization in modern high-performance Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Our implementation has demonstrated a hash function bottleneck caused by the sequential nature of SHA-2, as compared to the ability of concurrent execution of multiple lower-level operations during a polynomial multiplication. In order to address this bottleneck, we have proposed the use of a pseudorandom function based on the pipelined AES. Additionally, we have also suggested a method for eliminating the dependence of the execution time on the message size. Our code is intended to be made open-source to speed-up further design-space exploration and benchmarking on multiple hardware platforms.},

Although various fields of human activity, such as chemistry, medicine, and materials science, are likely to be dramatically affected by practical quantum computers, the most likely immediate impact will take place in the area of cryptography and cyber security. As a result of this potential threat, a new field of science has emerged, called Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). PQC is devoted to the design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant against any known attacks using quantum computers, but by themselves can be implemented using classical computing platforms, based on traditional modern semiconductor technologies. In this paper, we provide an overview and motivation for the PQC, NIST Standardization Effort, cryptographic competitions, and hardware benchmarking of candidates in cryptographic contests. Five major families of PQC schemes, code-, hash-, isogeny-, lattice-, and multivariate-based, are shortly introduced. The challenges of fair and comprehensive hardware benchmarking of PQC submissions are highlighted, together with the possible ways of overcoming these difficulties, such as the use of a common API, development packages, specialized libraries, and high-level synthesis.},

The quantum immunity can be implemented in the cryptographic layer, e.g., by using recent lattice-based key exchange algorithms NewHope or Frodo, or in the physical layer of wireless communication, by utilizing eavesdropping-resistant secrecy coding techniques. In this study, we explore and compare the feasibility and energy efﬁciency of selected cryptographic layer and physical layer approaches by applying an evaluation approach that is based on simulation and modeling. In particular, we consider NewHope and Frodo key exchange algorithms as well as novel physical layer secrecy coding approach that is based on polar codes. The results reveal that our proposed physical layer implementation is very competitive with respect to the cryptographic solutions, particularly in short-range wireless communication. We also observed that the total energy consumption is unequally divided between transmitting and receiving devices in all the studied approaches. This may be an advantage when designing security architectures for energy-restricted devices.},

  abstract = {Post-quantum cryptographic schemes have been developed in the last decade in response to the rise of quantum computers. Fortunately, several schemes have been developed with quantum resistance. However, there is very little effort in evaluating and comparing these schemes in the embedded settings. Low cost embedded devices represents a highly-constraint environment that challenges all post-quantum cryptographic schemes. Moreover, there are even fewer efforts in evaluating the security of these schemes against implementation attacks including side-channel and fault attacks. It is commonly accepted that, any embedded cryptographic module that is built without a sound countermeasure, can be easily broken. Therefore, we investigate the question: Are we ready to implement post-quantum cryptographic schemes on embedded systems? We present an exhaustive survey of research efforts in designing embedded modules of post-quantum cryptographic schemes and the efforts in securing these modules against implementation attacks. Unfortunately, the study shows that: we are not ready yet to implement any post-quantum cryptographic scheme in practical embedded systems. There is still a considerable amount of research that needs to be conducted before reaching a satisfactory level of security.},

  abstract = {Multipliers requiring large bit lengths have a major impact on the performance of many applications, such as cryptography, digital signal processing (DSP) and image processing. Novel, optimised designs of large integer multiplication are needed as previous approaches, such as schoolbook multiplication, may not be as feasible due to the large parameter sizes. Parameter bit lengths of up to millions of bits are required for use in cryptography, such as in lattice-based and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. This paper presents a comparison of hardware architectures for large integer multiplication. Several multiplication methods and combinations thereof are analysed for suitability in hardware designs, targeting the FPGA platform. In particular, the first hardware architecture combining Karatsuba and Comba multiplication is proposed. Moreover, a hardware complexity analysis is conducted to give results independent of any particular FPGA platform. It is shown that hardware designs of combination multipliers, at a cost of additional hardware resource usage, can offer lower latency compared to individual multiplier designs. Indeed, the proposed novel combination hardware design of the Karatsuba-Comba multiplier offers lowest latency for integers greater than 512 bits. For large multiplicands, greater than 16,384 bits, the hardware complexity analysis indicates that the NTT-Karatsuba-Schoolbook combination is most suitable.},

  abstract = {Recent research in the field of lattice-based cryptography, especially on the topic of the ring-based primitive ring-LWE, provided efficient and practical ring-based cryptographic schemes, which can compete with more traditional number-theoretic ones. In the case of ring-LWE these cryptographic schemes operated mainly in power-of-two cyclotomics, which vastly restricted the variety of possible applications. Due to the toolkit for ring-LWE of Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev, there are now cryptographic schemes that operate in arbitrary cyclotomics, with no loss in their underlying hardness guarantees, and only little loss computational efficiency. Next to some further refinements and explanations of the theory and additional implementation notes, we provide the - as far as we know - first implementation of the toolkit of Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev. This includes a complete framework with fast and modular algorithms that can be used to build cryptographic schemes around ring-LWE. Our framework is easy to use, open source and has only little third party dependencies. For demonstration purposes we implemented two public-key cryptographic schemes using our framework. The complete source code is available at https://github.com/CMMayer/Toolkit-for-Ring-LWE.git.},

This module includes multiplication in polynomial rings using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In order to implement lattice-based cryptography in an efficient way, it is crucial to apply the systems over polynomial rings. FFT speeds up multiplication in polynomial rings, which is the most critical operation in lattice-based cryptography, from quadratic to quasi-linear runtime. For the hardware variant, we show how this fundamental building block of lattice-based cryptography can be implemented and evaluated in terms of performance. A second important component for lattice-based cryptosystems is the sampling from discrete Gaussian distributions. We examine three different variants for sampling Gaussian distributed integers, namely rejection sampling, a rounding based approach, and a look-up table based approach in hardware.},

By these measures and for the same lattice dimension, we more than double the security parameter, halve the communication overhead, and speed up computation by more than a factor of 8 in a portable C implementation and by more than a factor of 27 in an optimized implementation targeting current Intel CPUs. These speedups are achieved with comprehensive protection against timing attacks.},

With the advent of powerful quantum computers public key cryptographic schemes will become vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm, undermining the security current communications systems. Post-quantum (or quantum-resistant) cryptography is an active research area, endeavoring to develop novel and quantum resistant public key cryptography. Amongst the various classes of quantum-resistant cryptography schemes, lattice-based cryptography is emerging as one of the most viable options. Its efficient implementation on software and on commodity hardware has already been shown to compete and even excel the performance of current classical security public-key schemes. This work discusses the next step in terms of their practical deployment, i.e., addressing the physical security of lattice-based cryptographic implementations. We survey the state-of-the-art in terms of side channel attacks (SCA), both invasive and passive attacks, and proposed countermeasures. Although the weaknesses exposed have led to countermeasures for these schemes, the cost, practicality and effectiveness of these on multiple implementation platforms, however, remains under-studied.},

When parameters are carefully chosen, our construction is resistant against any state-of-the-art cryptanalytic techniques (e.g., attacks on original Ring-LWE or NTRU) and suitable for low-cost scenarios. In the end, our scheme can enable public-key encryption even on very small and low-cost 8-bit (ATXmega128) and 32-bit (Cortex-M0) microcontrollers.},

In an unprotected ring-LWE decryption, the recovered plaintext is computed by first performing polynomial arithmetic on the secret key and then decoding the result. We mask the polynomial operations by arithmetically splitting the secret key polynomial into two random shares; the final decoding operation is performed using a new bespoke masked decoder. The outputs of our masked ring-LWE decryption are Boolean shares suitable for derivation of a symmetric key. Thus, the masking scheme keeps all intermediates, including the recovered plaintext, in the masked domain. We have implemented the masking scheme on both hardware and software.

Discrete Gaussian samplers are a core building block in most, if not all, lattice-based cryptosystems, and optimised samplers are desirable both for high-speed and low-area applications. Due to the inherent structure of existing discrete Gaussian sampling methods, lattice-based cryptosystems are vulnerable to side-channel attacks, such as timing analysis. In this paper, the first comprehensive evaluation of discrete Gaussian samplers in hardware is presented, targeting FPGA devices. Novel optimised discrete Gaussian sampler hardware architectures are proposed for the main sampling techniques. An independent-time design of each of the samplers is presented, offering security against side-channel timing attacks, including the first proposed constant-time Bernoulli, KnuthYao, and discrete Ziggurat sampler hardware designs. For a balanced performance, the Cumulative Distribution Table (CDT) sampler is recommended, with the proposed hardware CDT design achieving a throughput of 59.4 million samples per second for encryption, utilising just 43 slices on a Virtex 6 FPGA and 16.3 million samples per second for signatures with 179 slices on a Spartan 6 device.},

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography, one of the leading candidates for post-quantum security, relies heavily on discrete Gaussian samplers to provide necessary uncertainty, obfuscating computations on secret information. For reconfigurable hardware, the cumulative distribution table (CDT) scheme has previously been shown to achieve the highest throughput and the smallest resource utilisation, easily outperforming other existing samplers. However, the CDT sampler does not scale well. In fact, for large parameters, the lookup tables required are far too large to be practically implemented. This research proposes a hierarchy of multiple smaller samplers, extending the Gaussian convolution lemma to compute optimal parameters, where the individual samplers require much smaller lookup tables. A large range of parameter sets, covering encryption, signatures, and key exchange are evaluated. Hardware-optimised parameters are formulated and a practical implementation on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA device is realised. The proposed sampling designs demonstrate promising performance on reconfigurable hardware, even for large parameters, that were otherwise thought infeasible.},

In the second, z is an independent input. This is suitable for RNS number system applications, for example. The second version can be pipelined in O(n) stages.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new masking scheme for ring-LWE decryption. Our scheme exploits the additively-homomorphic property of the existing ring-LWE encryption schemes and computes an additive-mask as an encryption of a random message. Our solution differs in several aspects from the recent masked ring-LWE implementation by Reparaz et al. presented at CHES 2015; most notably we do not require a masked decoder but work with a conventional, unmasked decoder. As such, we can secure a ring-LWE implementation using additive masking with minimal changes. Our masking scheme is also very generic in the sense that it can be applied to other additively-homomorphic encryption schemes.},

  abstract = {We describe new arithmetic coding techniques and side-channel blinding countermeasures for lattice-based cryptography. Using these techniques, we develop a practical, compact, and more quantum-resistant variant of the BLISS Ideal Lattice Signature Scheme. We first show how the BLISS parameters and hash-based random oracle can be modified to be more secure against quantum pre-image attacks while optimizing signature size. Arithmetic Coding offers an information theoretically optimal compression for stationary and memoryless sources, such as the discrete Gaussian distributions often present in lattice-based cryptography. We show that this technique gives better signature sizes than the previously proposed advanced Huffman-based signature compressors. We further demonstrate that arithmetic decoding from an uniform source to target distribution is also an optimal non-uniform sampling method in the sense that a minimal amount of true random bits is required. Performance of this new Binary Arithmetic Coding sampler is comparable to other practical samplers. The same code, tables, or circuitry can be utilized for both tasks, eliminating the need for separate sampling and compression components. We then describe simple randomized blinding techniques that can be applied to anti-cyclic polynomial multiplication to mask timing- and power consumption side-channels in ring arithmetic. We further show that the Gaussian sampling process can also be blinded by a split-and-permute techniques as an effective countermeasure against side-channel attacks.},

In this paper, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with a linearithmic complexity of O(nlogn), is exploited in the design of a high-speed polynomial multiplier. A constant geometry FFT datapath is used in the computation to simplify the control of the architecture. The contribution of this work is three-fold. First, parameter sets which support both an efficient modular reduction design and the security requirements for ring-LWE encryption and SHE are provided. Second, a versatile pipelined architecture accompanied with an improved dataflow are proposed to obtain a high-speed polynomial multiplier. Third, the proposed architecture supports polynomial multiplications for different lengths n and moduli p. The experimental results on a Spartan-6 FPGA show that the proposed design results in a speedup of 3.5 times on average when compared with the state of the art. It performs a polynomial multiplication in the ring-LWE scheme (n=256,p=1049089) and the SHE scheme (n=1024,p=536903681) in only 6.3 μs and 33.1 μs, respectively.},

Our polynomial multipliers are capable to calculate the product of two n-degree polynomials in about (1.5n lg n+1.5n)/b clock cycles, where b is the number of the butterﬂy operators.

The modular arithmetic is important for a wide variety of computations in these devices, from communication to signal processing. To speed up some cryptographic operations, the most widespread devices often have some cryptographic support provided by a dedicated chip. Our goal is to use the resources of a crypto-coprocessor to accelerate general modular operations. The paper describes our implementation of modular arithmetic operations with large integers, and provides the comparison of the accelerated method with three classical methods for (modular) multiplication. The standard methods are represented by the operand-scanning multiplication algorithm (the school-book method), the product-scanning method (Comba's method) and the Montgomery multiplication. The accelerated method is based on using the RSA encryption support for multiplication tunnelling. The performance characteristics of standard methods and the advanced method called `RSA tunnel' are compared and concluded.},

It is commonly used in cryptographic schemes that are based on the hardness of the Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem to efficiently implement modular polynomial multiplication.

We present a new modular reduction technique that is tailored for the special moduli required by the NTT. Based on this reduction, we speed up the NTT and propose faster, multi-purpose algorithms. We present two implementations of these algorithms: a portable C implementation and a high-speed implementation using assembly with AVX2 instructions. To demonstrate the improved efficiency in an application example, we benchmarked the algorithms in the context of the R-LWE key exchange protocol that has recently been proposed by Alkim, Ducas, Pöppelmann and Schwabe. In this case, our C and assembly implementations compute the full key exchange 1.49 and 1.13 times faster, respectively. These results are achieved with full protection against timing attacks.},

Since Keccak has been selected as the winner of the NIST SHA-3 competition in 2012, there is the question of how far we can push the limits of Keccak to fulﬁll the stringent requirements of passive low-cost RFID. In this paper, we address this question by presenting a hardware implementation of Keccak that aims for lowest power and lowest area. Our smallest (fullstate) design requires only 2 927 GEs (for designs with external memory available) and 5 522 GEs (total size including memory). It has a power consumption of 12.5 µW at 1 MHz on a low leakage 130 nm CMOS process technology. As a result, we provide a design that needs 40 \% less resources than related work. Our design is even smaller than the smallest SHA-1 and SHA-2 implementations.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of dividing a two-word integer by a single-word integer, together with a few extensions and applications. Due to lack of efﬁcient division instructions in current processors, the division is performed as a multiplication using a precomputed single-word approximation of the reciprocal of the divisor, followed by a couple of adjustment steps. There are three common types of unsigned multiplication instructions; we deﬁne full word multiplication (umul) which produces the two-word product of two single-word integers, low multiplication (umullo) which produces only the least signiﬁcant word of the product, and high multiplication (umulhi), which produces only the most signiﬁcant word. We describe an algorithm which produces a quotient and remainder using one umul and one umullo. This is an improvement over earlier methods, since the new method uses cheaper multiplication operations. It turns out we also get some additional savings from simpler adjustment conditions. The algorithm has been implemented in version 4.3 of the GMP library. When applied to the problem of dividing a large integer by a single word, the new algorithm gives a speedup of roughly 30\%, benchmarked on AMD and Intel processors in the x86 64 family.},

The problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems, and in recent years it has served as the foundation for a plethora of cryptographic applications. Unfortunately, these applications are rather inefﬁcient due to an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of LWE. A main open question was whether LWE and its applications could be made truly efﬁcient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).},

  abstract = {The CCA-secure lattice-based post-quantum key encapsulation scheme Saber is a candidate in the NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization process. In this paper, we study the implementation aspects of Saber in resource-constrained microcontrollers from the ARM Cortex-M series which are very popular for realizing IoT applications. In this work, we carefully optimize various parts of Saber for speed and memory. We exploit digital signal processing instructions and efficient memory access for a fast implementation of polynomial multiplication. We also use memory efficient Karatsuba and just-in-time strategy for generating the public matrix of the module lattice to reduce the memory footprint. We also show that our optimizations can be combined with each other seamlessly to provide various speed-memory trade-offs. Our speed optimized software takes just 1,147K, 1,444K, and 1,543K clock cycles on a Cortex-M4 platform for key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation respectively. Our memory efficient software takes 4,786K, 6,328K, and 7,509K clock cycles on an ultra resource-constrained Cortex-M0 platform for key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation respectively while consuming only 6.2 KB of memory at most. These results show that lattice-based key encapsulation schemes are perfectly practical for securing IoT devices from quantum computing attacks.},

  abstract = {Sampling from a discrete Gaussian distribution is an indispensable part of lattice-based cryptography. Several recent works have shown that the timing leakage from a non-constant-time implementation of the discrete Gaussian sampling algorithm could be exploited to recover the secret. In this paper, we propose a constant-time implementation of the Knuth-Yao random walk algorithm for performing constant-time discrete Gaussian sampling. Since the random walk is dictated by a set of input random bits, we can express the generated sample as a function of the input random bits. Hence, our constant-time implementation expresses the unique mapping of the input random-bits to the output sample-bits as a Boolean expression of the random-bits. We use bit-slicing to generate multiple samples in batches and thus increase the throughput of our constant-time sampling manifold. Our experiments on an Intel i7-Broadwell processor show that our method can be as much as 2.4 times faster than the constant-time implementation of cumulative distribution table based sampling and consumes exponentially less memory than the Knuth-Yao algorithm with shuffling for a similar level of security.},

In this work we revisit their instantiation and stand-alone implementation. Specifically, we propose new parameters and a better suited error distribution, analyze the scheme's hardness against attacks by quantum computers in a conservative way, introduce a new and more efficient error-reconciliation mechanism, and propose a defense against backdoors and all-for-the-price-of-one attacks. By these measures and for the same lattice dimension, we more than double the security parameter, halve the communication overhead, and speed up computation by more than a factor of 8 in a portable C implementation and by more than a factor of 27 in an optimized implementation targeting current Intel CPUs. These speedups are achieved with comprehensive protection against timing attacks.},

Background  In recent years, there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers – machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere.~ The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems...},

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography oﬀers some of the most attractive primitives believed to be resistant to quantum computers. Following increasing interest from both companies and government agencies in building quantum computers, a number of works have proposed instantiations of practical post-quantum key exchange protocols based on hard problems in ideal lattices, mainly based on the Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem. While ideal lattices facilitate major eﬃciency and storage beneﬁts over their non-ideal counterparts, the additional ring structure that enables these advantages also raises concerns about the assumed diﬃculty of the underlying problems. Thus, a question of signiﬁcant interest to cryptographers, and especially to those currently placing bets on primitives that will withstand quantum adversaries, is how much of an advantage the additional ring structure actually gives in practice.},

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography is one of the most promising candidates being considered to replace current public-key systems in the era of quantum computing. In 2016, Bos et al. proposed the key exchange scheme FrodoCCS, that is also a submission to the NIST post-quantum standardization process, modified as a key encapsulation mechanism (FrodoKEM). The security of the scheme is based on standard lattices and the learning with errors problem. Due to the large parameters, standard lattice-based schemes have long been considered impractical on embedded devices. The FrodoKEM proposal actually comes with parameters that bring standard lattice-based cryptography within reach of being feasible on constrained devices. In this work, we take the final step of efficiently implementing the scheme on a low-cost FPGA and microcontroller devices and thus making conservative post-quantum cryptography practical on small devices. Our FPGA implementation of the decapsulation (the computationally most expensive operation) needs 7,220 look-up tables (LUTs), 3,549 flip-flops (FFs), a single DSP, and only 16 block RAM modules. The maximum clock frequency is 162 MHz and it takes 20.7 ms for the execution of the decapsulation. Our microcontroller implementation has a 66\% reduced peak stack usage in comparison to the reference implementation and needs 266 ms for key pair generation, 284 ms for encapsulation, and 286 ms for encapsulation. Our results contribute to the practical evaluation of a post-quantum standardization candidate.},

At Usenix Security 2016, Alkim, Ducas, Pöpplemann, and Schwabe proposed a post-quantum key exchange scheme called NewHope, based on a variant of lattice problem, the ring-learning-with-errors (RLWE) problem. In this work, we propose a high performance hardware architecture for NewHope.

In our hardware design of NewHope key exchange, the three phases of key exchange costs 51.9, 78.6 and 21.1 microseconds, respectively.

  url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/090},
  abstract = {Most lattice-based cryptographic schemes are built upon the assumed hardness of the Short Integer Solution (SIS) and Learning With Errors (LWE) problems. Their efficiencies can be drastically improved by switching the hardness assumptions to the more compact Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE problems. However, this change of hardness assumptions comes along with a possible security weakening: SIS and LWE are known to be at least as hard as standard (worst-case) problems on euclidean lattices, whereas Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE are only known to be as hard as their restrictions to special classes of ideal lattices, corresponding to ideals of some polynomial rings. In this work, we define the Module-SIS and Module-LWE problems, which bridge SIS with Ring-SIS, and LWE with Ring-LWE, respectively. We prove that these average-case problems are at least as hard as standard lattice problems restricted to module lattices (which themselves generalize arbitrary and ideal lattices). As these new problems enlarge the toolbox of the lattice-based cryptographer, they could prove useful for designing new schemes. Importantly, the worst-case to average-case reductions for the module problems are (qualitatively) sharp, in the sense that there exist converse reductions. This property is not known to hold in the context of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE: Ideal lattice problems could reveal easy without impacting the hardness of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE.},

That situation arises in the context of the circular convolution theorem. The identical operation can also be expressed in terms of the periodic summations of both functions, if the infinite integration interval is reduced to just one period.  That situation arises in the context of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) and is also called periodic convolution.

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography has shown great potential due to its resistance against quantum attacks. With the security requirements for high-precision Gaussian sampling and complex polynomial multiplication over rings, as well as storage of large public-keys, it is extremely challengeable but important to implement lattice-based schemes on resources constrained devices. In this paper, a resource-efficient and side-channel secure Ring-LWE cryptographic processor is presented. A discrete Gaussian sampler with constant response time, high precision, and large distribution tails is designed. The proposed Gaussian sampler is proven to be secure against side-channel timing attack according to the timing analysis attack results on a FPGA-based testing platform. A universal module MPE (Modular Processing Element) is designed to carry out all basic modular operations for Ring-LWE cryptography with high speed. The prototype verification is performed on the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA platform. The processor can execute an encryption/decryption operation on a 256-bit message in 4.5/0.9 ms whilst it consumes only 1307 LUTs, 889 FFs, 4 BRAMs, and none DSP module. Compared with other related hardware implementations, the Ring-LWE processor is advantageous not only in hardware efficiency but also in secure protection against side-channel attacks.},
