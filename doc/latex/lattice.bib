That situation arises in the context of the circular convolution theorem. The identical operation can also be expressed in terms of the periodic summations of both functions, if the infinite integration interval is reduced to just one period.  That situation arises in the context of the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) and is also called periodic convolution.},

  abstract = {Ciphertext indistinguishability is a property of many encryption schemes. Intuitively, if a cryptosystem possesses the property of indistinguishability, then an adversary will be unable to distinguish pairs of ciphertexts based on the message they encrypt. The property of indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is considered a basic requirement for most provably secure public key cryptosystems, though some schemes also provide indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. Indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is equivalent to the property of semantic security, and many cryptographic proofs use these definitions interchangeably.
A cryptosystem is considered secure in terms of indistinguishability if no adversary, given an encryption of a message randomly chosen from a two-element message space determined by the adversary, can identify the message choice with probability significantly better than that of random guessing (\mbox{}1⁄2). If any adversary can succeed in distinguishing the chosen ciphertext with a probability significantly greater than \mbox{}1⁄2, then this adversary is considered to have an "advantage" in distinguishing the ciphertext, and the scheme is not considered secure in terms of indistinguishability. This definition encompasses the notion that in a secure scheme, the adversary should learn no information from seeing a ciphertext. Therefore, the adversary should be able to do no better than if it guessed randomly.},

NTRU is one of the well-known algorithms due to its practical key sizes and fast performance along with the resistance against the quantum adversary. Although NTRU has withstood various algebraic attacks, its side-channel resistance must also be considered for secure implementation. In this paper, we proposed the first single trace attack on NTRU. Previous side-channel attacks on NTRU used numerous power traces, which increase the attack complexity and limit the target algorithm. There are two versions of NTRU implementation published in succession. We demonstrated our attack on both implementations using a single power consumption trace obtained in the decryption phase. Furthermore, we propose a countermeasure to prevent the proposed attacks. Our countermeasure does not degrade in terms of performance.},

As this is a relatively new topic, the search for efficient hardware architectures for lattice-based cryptographic building blocks is still an active area of research. We present area optimizations for the most critical and computationally-intensive operation in lattice-based cryptography: polynomial multiplication with the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). The proposed methods are implemented on an FPGA for polynomial multiplication over the ideal ℤp[x]〈xn+ 1〉. The proposed hardware architectures reduce slice usage, number of utilized memory blocks and total memory accesses by using a simplified address generation, improved memory organization and on-the-fly operand generations. Compared to prior work, with similar performance the proposed hardware architectures can save up to 67\% of occupied slices, 80\% of used memory blocks and 60\% of memory accesses, and can fit into smallest Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA.},

We demonstrate that a direct implementation of B-RLWE exhibits vulnerability to power side-channel attacks, even to Simple Power Analysis, due to the nature of binary coefficients. We mitigate this vulnerability with a redundant addition and memory update. To further protect against Differential Power Analysis (DPA), we use a B-RLWE specific opportunity to construct a lightweight yet effective countermeasure based on randomization of intermediate states and masked threshold decoding. On a SAKURA-G FPGA board, we show that our method increases the required number of measurements for DPA attacks by 40 χ compared to unprotected design.

  abstract = {Recently, numerous physical attacks have been demonstrated against lattice-based schemes, often exploiting their unique properties such as the reliance on Gaussian distributions, rejection sampling and FFT-based polynomial multiplication. As the call for concrete implementations and deployment of postquantum cryptography becomes more pressing, protecting against those attacks is an important problem. However, few countermeasures have been proposed so far. In particular, masking has been applied to the decryption procedure of some lattice-based encryption schemes, but the much more difficult case of signatures (which are highly non-linear and typically involve randomness) has not been considered until now. In this paper, we describe the first masked implementation of a lattice-based signature scheme. Since masking Gaussian sampling and other procedures involving contrived probability distribution would be prohibitively inefficient, we focus on the GLP scheme of Güneysu, Lyubashevsky and Pöppelmann (CHES 2012). We show how to provably mask it in the Ishai--Sahai--Wagner model (CRYPTO 2003) at any order in a relatively efficient manner, using extensions of the techniques of Coron et al for converting between arithmetic and Boolean masking. Our proof relies on a mild generalization of probing security that supports the notion of public outputs. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation to assess the efficiency of the proposed countermeasure.},

Scientists are developing post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms, that are invulnerable to quantum computer attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started a public evaluation process to standardize quantum-resistant public key algorithms. The objective of our study is to provide a hardware comparison of the NIST PQC competition candidates. For this, we use a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) hardware design methodology to map high-level C specifications of selected PQC candidates into both FPGA and ASIC implementations.},

Following increasing interest from both companies and government agencies in building quantum computers, a number of works have proposed instantiations of practical post-quantum key exchange protocols based on hard problems in ideal lattices, mainly based on the Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem. While ideal lattices facilitate major efficiency and storage benefits over their non-ideal counterparts, the additional ring structure that enables these advantages also raises concerns about the assumed difficulty of the underlying problems. Thus, a question of significant interest to cryptographers, and especially to those currently placing bets on primitives that will withstand quantum adversaries, is how much of an advantage the additional ring structure actually gives in practice.},

  abstract = {Lattice-based schemes are among the most promising post-quantum schemes, yet the effect of both parameter and implementation choices on their side-channel resilience is still poorly understood. Aysu et al. (HOST'18) recently investigated single-trace attacks against the core lattice operation, namely multiplication between a public matrix and a "small" secret vector, in the context of a hardware implementation. We complement this work by considering single-trace attacks against software implementations of "ring-less" LWE-based constructions. Specifically, we target Frodo, one of the submissions to the standardisation process of NIST, when implemented on an (emulated) ARM Cortex M0 processor. We confirm Aysu et al.'s observation that a standard divide-and-conquer attack is insufficient and instead we resort to a sequential, extend-and-prune approach. In contrast to Aysu et al. we find that, in our setting where the power model is far from being as clear as theirs, both profiling and less aggressive pruning are needed to obtain reasonable key recovery rates for SNRs of practical relevance. Our work drives home the message that parameter selection for LWE schemes is a double-edged sword: the schemes that are deemed most secure against (black-box) lattice attacks can provide the least security when considering side-channels. Finally, we suggest some easy countermeasures that thwart standard extend-and-prune attacks.},

Kyber is one of the round-2 candidates in the NIST post-quantum project. In the center of our work are novel optimization techniques for the number-theoretic transform (NTT) inside Kyber, which make very efficient use of the computational power offered by the “vector” DSP instructions of the target architecture. We also present results for the recently updated parameter sets of Kyber which equally benefit from our optimizations. As a result of our efforts we present software that is 18\% faster than an earlier implementation of Kyber optimized for the Cortex-M4 by the Kyber submitters. Our NTT is more than twice as fast as the NTT in that software. Our software runs at about the same speed as the latest speed-optimized implementation of the other module-lattice based round-2 NIST PQC candidate Saber. However, for our Kyber software, this performance is achieved with a much smaller RAM footprint. Kyber needs less than half of the RAM of what the considerably slower RAM-optimized version of Saber uses. Our software does not make use of any secret-dependent branches or memory access and thus offers state-of-the-art protection against timing attacks},

Since conventional public-key schemes, such as ECC and RSA, remain expensive and energy hungry even after aggressive optimization, this work investigates a possible alternative. In particular, we show the practical potential of replacing the Gaussian noise distribution in the Ring-LWE based encryption scheme by Lindner and Peikert/Lyubashevsky et al. with a binary distribution. When parameters are carefully chosen, our construction is resistant against any state-of-the-art cryptanalytic techniques (e.g., attacks on original Ring-LWE or NTRU) and suitable for low-cost scenarios. In the end, our scheme can enable public-key encryption even on very small and low-cost 8-bit (ATXmega128) and 32-bit (Cortex-M0) microcontrollers.},

The Dilithium signature scheme is based on the Fiat-Shamir paradigm and can be seen as a variant of the Bai-Galbraith scheme (BG) combined with several improvements from previous ancestor lattice-based schemes like GLP and BLISS signature schemes. One of the main features of Dilithium is the compressed public-key, which is a rounded version of the LWE instance. This implies that Dilithium is not breakable with the knowledge of only the secret or the error of the LWE instance, unlike its ancestor lattice-based signature schemes. In this paper, we investigate the security of Dilithium against a combination of side-channel and classical attacks. Side-channel attacks on schoolbook and optimised polynomial multiplication algorithms in the signing procedure are shown to extract the secret component of the LWE instance, which is just one among the multiple components of the secret-key of Dilithium. We then propose an alternative signing procedure, through which it is possible to forge signatures with only the extracted portion of the secret-key, without requiring the knowledge of all its elements. Thus showing that Dilithium too breaks on just knowing the secret portion of the LWE instance, similar to previous lattice-based schemes.},

A constant geometry FFT datapath is used in the computation to simplify the control of the architecture. The contribution of this work is three-fold. First, parameter sets which support both an efficient modular reduction design and the security requirements for ring-LWE encryption and SHE are provided. Second, a versatile pipelined architecture accompanied with an improved dataflow are proposed to obtain a high-speed polynomial multiplier. Third, the proposed architecture supports polynomial multiplications for different lengths n and moduli p. The experimental results on a Spartan-6 FPGA show that the proposed design results in a speedup of 3.5 times on average when compared with the state of the art. It performs a polynomial multiplication in the ring-LWE scheme (n=256,p=1049089) and the SHE scheme (n=1024,p=536903681) in only 6.3 μs and 33.1 μs, respectively.},

  abstract = {Several cryptosystems based on exponentiation have been proposed in recent years. Some of these are of the public key variety and offer notable advantages in cryptographic key management, both for secret communication and for message authentication. The need for extensive arithmetic calculations with very large integers (hundreds of digits long) is a drawback of these systems. This paper describes a set of experimental programs that were developed to demonstrate that exponentiation cryptosystems can be efficiently implemented on the IBM Personal Computer (PC). The programs are organized into four layers, comprising procedures for: multiple precision integer arithmetic, modular exponentiation, prime number generation and testing, and cryptographic key generation. The major emphasis of the paper is on methods and techniques for improving execution speed. The items discussed include: the use of a specialized squaring procedure; a recursive splitting method to speed up squaring and multiplication; the computation of residues by using multiplication instead of division; the efficient encoding of residue information; and the use of thresholds to select the most effective primality testing algorithm for a given size number. Timing results are presented and discussed. Finally, the paper discusses the advantages of a mixed system that combines the superior key management capabilities inherent in public key cryptosystems with the much higher bulk-encryption speed obtainable with the Data Encryption Algorithm.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce Saber, a package of cryptographic primitives whose security relies on the hardness of the Module Learning With Rounding problem (Mod-LWR). We first describe a secure Diffie-Hellman type key exchange protocol, which is then transformed into an IND-CPA encryption scheme and finally into an IND-CCA secure key encapsulation mechanism using a post-quantum version of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform. The design goals of this package were simplicity, efficiency and flexibility resulting in the following choices: all integer moduli are powers of 2 avoiding modular reduction and rejection sampling entirely; the use of LWR halves the amount of randomness required compared to LWE-based schemes and reduces bandwidth; the module structure provides flexibility by reusing one core component for multiple security levels. A constant-time AVX2 optimized software implementation of the KEM with parameters providing more than 128 bits of post-quantum security, requires only 101K, 125K and 129K cycles for key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation respectively on a Dell laptop with an Intel i7-Haswell processor.},

  title = {Unifying {{Leakage Models}}: From {{Probing Attacks}} to {{Noisy Leakage}}},
  author = {Duc, Alexandre and Dziembowski, Stefan and Faust, Sebastian},
  pages = {23},
  abstract = {A recent trend in cryptography is to formally show the leakage resilience of cryptographic implementations in a given leakage model. One of the most prominent leakage models –the so-called bounded leakage model – assumes that the amount of leakage is a-priori bounded. Unfortunately, it has been pointed out that the assumption of bounded leakages is hard to verify in practice. A more realistic assumption is to assume that leakages are sufficiently noisy, following the engineering observation that real-world physical leakages are inherently noisy. While the noisy leakage assumption has first been studied in the seminal work of Chari et al. (CRYPTO 99), the recent work of Prouff and Rivain (Eurocrypt 2013) provides the first analysis of a full masking scheme under a physically motivated noise model. In particular, the authors show that a block-cipher implementation that uses an additive masking scheme is secure against noisy leakages. Unfortunately, the security analysis of Prouff and Rivain has three important shortcomings: (1) it requires leak-free gates, (2) it considers a restricted adversarial model (random message attacks), and (3) the security proof has limited application for cryptographic settings. In this work, we provide an alternative security proof in the same noisy model that overcomes these three challenges. We achieve this goal by a new reduction from noisy leakage to the important theoretical model of probing adversaries (Ishai et al – CRYPTO 2003). Our work can be viewed as a next step of closing the gap between theory and practice in leakage resilient cryptography: while our security proofs heavily rely on concepts of theoretical cryptography, we solve problems in practically motivated leakage models.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the security of the BLISS lattice-based signature scheme, one of the most promising candidates for postquantum-secure signatures, against side-channel attacks. Several works have been devoted to its efficient implementation on various platforms, from desktop CPUs to microcontrollers and FPGAs, and more recent papers have also considered its security against certain types of physical attacks, notably fault injection and cache attacks. We turn to more traditional side-channel analysis, and describe several attacks that can yield a full key recovery. We first identify a serious source of leakage in the rejection sampling algorithm used during signature generation. Existing implementations of that rejection sampling step, which is essential for security, actually leak the "relative norm" of the secret key. We show how an extension of an algorithm due to Howgrave-Graham and Szydlo can be used to recover the key from that relative norm, at least when the absolute norm is easy to factor (which happens for a significant fraction of secret keys). We describe how this leakage can be exploited in practice both on an embedded device (an 8-bit AVR microcontroller) using electromagnetic analysis (EMA), and a desktop computer (recent Intel CPU running Linux) using branch tracing. The latter attack has been mounted against the open source VPN software strongSwan. We also show that other parts of the BLISS signing algorithm can leak secrets not just for a subset of secret keys, but for 100\% of them. The BLISS Gaussian sampling algorithm in strongSwan is intrinsically variable time. This would be hard to exploit using a noisy source of leakage like EMA, but branch tracing allows to recover the entire randomness and hence the key: we show that a single execution of the strongSwan signature algorithm is actually sufficient for full key recovery. We also describe a more traditional side-channel attack on the sparse polynomial multiplications carried out in BLISS: classically, multiplications can be attacked using DPA; however, our target 8-bit AVR target implementation uses repeated shifted additions instead. Surprisingly, we manage to obtain a full key recovery in that setting using integer linear programming from a single EMA trace.},

  abstract = {Practical quantum computers have been recently selected as one of 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017 by the MIT Technology Review. Although various fields of human activity, such as chemistry, medicine, and materials science, are likely to be dramatically affected by practical quantum computers, the most likely immediate impact will take place in the area of cryptography and cyber security. As a result of this potential threat, a new field of science has emerged, called Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). PQC is devoted to the design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant against any known attacks using quantum computers, but by themselves can be implemented using classical computing platforms, based on traditional modern semiconductor technologies. In this paper, we provide an overview and motivation for the PQC, NIST Standardization Effort, cryptographic competitions, and hardware benchmarking of candidates in cryptographic contests. Five major families of PQC schemes, code-, hash-, isogeny-, lattice-, and multivariate-based, are shortly introduced. The challenges of fair and comprehensive hardware benchmarking of PQC submissions are highlighted, together with the possible ways of overcoming these difficulties, such as the use of a common API, development packages, specialized libraries, and high-level synthesis.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we extend the applicability of differential fault attacks to lattice-based cryptography. We show how two deterministic lattice-based signature schemes, Dilithium and qTESLA, are vulnerable to such attacks. In particular, we demonstrate that single random faults can result in a nonce-reuse scenario which allows key recovery. We also expand this to fault-induced partial nonce-reuse attacks, which do not corrupt the validity of the computed signatures and thus are harder to detect. Using linear algebra and lattice-basis reduction techniques, an attacker can extract one of the secret key elements after a successful fault injection. Some other parts of the key cannot be recovered, but we show that a tweaked signature algorithm can still successfully sign any message. We provide experimental verification of our attacks by performing clock glitching on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. In particular, we show that up to 65.2\% of the execution time of Dilithium is vulnerable to an unprofiled attack, where a random fault is injected anywhere during the signing procedure and still leads to a successful key-recovery.},

As a consequence, the appearance of quantum computers or algorithmic advances on these problems may lead to the unpleasant situation that a large number of today's schemes will most likely need to be replaced with more secure alternatives. In this work we present such an alternative-an efficient signature scheme whose security is derived from the hardness of lattice problems. It is based on recent theoretical advances in lattice-based cryptography and is highly optimized for practicability and use in embedded systems. The public and secret keys are roughly 1.5 kB and 0.3 kB long, while the signature size is approximately 1.1 kB for a security level of around 80 bits. We provide implementation results on reconfigurable hardware (Spartan/Virtex-6) and demonstrate that the scheme is scalable, has low area consumption, and even outperforms classical schemes.},

  abstract = {In many digital signal processing algorithms, e.g., linear transforms and digital filters, the multiplier coefficients are constant. Hence, it is possible to implement the multiplier using shifts, adders, and subtracters. In this work two approaches to realize constant coefficient multiplication with few adders and subtracters are presented. The first yields optimal results, i.e., a minimum number of adders and subtracters, but requires an exhaustive search. Compared with previous optimal approaches, redundancies in the exhaustive search cause the search time to be drastically decreased. The second is a heuristic approach based on signed-digit representation and subexpression sharing. The results for the heuristic are worse in only approximately 1\% of all coefficients up to 19 bits. However, the optimal approach results in several different optimal realizations, from which it is possible to pick the best one based on other criteria. Relations between the number of adders, possible coefficients, and number of cascaded adders are presented, as well as exact equations for the number of required full and half adder cells. The results show that the number of adders and subtracters decreases on average 25\% for 19-bit coefficients compared with the canonic signed-digit representation.},

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography has gained credence recently as a replacement for current public-key cryptosystems, due to its quantum-resilience, versatility, and relatively low key sizes. To date, encryption based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem has only been investigated from an ideal lattice standpoint, due to its computation and size efficiencies. However, a thorough investigation of standard lattices in practice has yet to be considered. Standard lattices may be preferred to ideal lattices due to their stronger security assumptions and less restrictive parameter selection process. In this paper, an area-optimised hardware architecture of a standard lattice-based cryptographic scheme is proposed. The design is implemented on a FPGA and it is found that both encryption and decryption fit comfortably on a Spartan-6 FPGA. This is the first hardware architecture for standard lattice-based cryptography reported in the literature to date, and thus is a benchmark for future implementations. Additionally, a revised discrete Gaussian sampler is proposed which is the fastest of its type to date, and also is the first to investigate the cost savings of implementing with λ/2-bits of precision. Performance results are promising compared to the hardware designs of the equivalent ring-LWE scheme, which in addition to providing stronger security proofs; generate 1272 encryptions per second and 4395 decryptions per second.},

Discrete Gaussian samplers are a core building block in most, if not all, lattice-based cryptosystems, and optimised samplers are desirable both for high-speed and low-area applications. Due to the inherent structure of existing discrete Gaussian sampling methods, lattice-based cryptosystems are vulnerable to side-channel attacks, such as timing analysis. In this paper, the first comprehensive evaluation of discrete Gaussian samplers in hardware is presented, targeting FPGA devices. Novel optimised discrete Gaussian sampler hardware architectures are proposed for the main sampling techniques. An independent-time design of each of the samplers is presented, offering security against side-channel timing attacks, including the first proposed constant-time Bernoulli, KnuthYao, and discrete Ziggurat sampler hardware designs. For a balanced performance, the Cumulative Distribution Table (CDT) sampler is recommended, with the proposed hardware CDT design achieving a throughput of 59.4 million samples per second for encryption, utilising just 43 slices on a Virtex 6 FPGA and 16.3 million samples per second for signatures with 179 slices on a Spartan 6 device.},

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography is one of the most promising candidates being considered to replace current public-key systems in the era of quantum computing. In 2016, Bos et al. proposed the key exchange scheme FrodoCCS, that is also a submission to the NIST post-quantum standardization process, modified as a key encapsulation mechanism (FrodoKEM). The security of the scheme is based on standard lattices and the learning with errors problem. Due to the large parameters, standard lattice-based schemes have long been considered impractical on embedded devices. The FrodoKEM proposal actually comes with parameters that bring standard lattice-based cryptography within reach of being feasible on constrained devices. In this work, we take the final step of efficiently implementing the scheme on a low-cost FPGA and microcontroller devices and thus making conservative post-quantum cryptography practical on small devices. Our FPGA implementation of the decapsulation (the computationally most expensive operation) needs 7,220 look-up tables (LUTs), 3,549 flip-flops (FFs), a single DSP, and only 16 block RAM modules. The maximum clock frequency is 162 MHz and it takes 20.7 ms for the execution of the decapsulation. Our microcontroller implementation has a 66\% reduced peak stack usage in comparison to the reference implementation and needs 266 ms for key pair generation, 284 ms for encapsulation, and 286 ms for encapsulation. Our results contribute to the practical evaluation of a post-quantum standardization candidate.},

These solutions must be secure against classical and post-quantum cryptanalysis techniques as well as feasible for all kinds of devices, including energy-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The quantum immunity can be implemented in the cryptographic layer, e.g., by using recent lattice-based key exchange algorithms NewHope or Frodo, or in the physical layer of wireless communication, by utilizing eavesdropping-resistant secrecy coding techniques. In this study, we explore and compare the feasibility and energy efficiency of selected cryptographic layer and physical layer approaches by applying an evaluation approach that is based on simulation and modeling. In particular, we consider NewHope and Frodo key exchange algorithms as well as novel physical layer secrecy coding approach that is based on polar codes. The results reveal that our proposed physical layer implementation is very competitive with respect to the cryptographic solutions, particularly in short-range wireless communication. We also observed that the total energy consumption is unequally divided between transmitting and receiving devices in all the studied approaches. This may be an advantage when designing security architectures for energy-restricted devices.},

In this paper, we have introduced a novel simulation platform for evaluation of power based SCA attacks and countermeasures. We have used Synopsys power analysis tools in order to simulate a processor and implement a successful Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attack on it. Then we focused on the simulation of a common countermeasure against DPA attacks called Random Delay Insertion (RDI). We simulated a resistant processor that uses this policy. In the next step we showed how the proposed framework can help to extract power characteristics of the simulated processor and implement power analysis based reverse engineering on it. We used this approach in order to detect DPA related assembly instructions being executed on the processor and performed a DPA attack on the RDI secured processor. Experiments were carried out on a Pico-blaze simulated processor.},

  abstract = {The NIST competition for developing the new cryptographic hash algorithm SHA-3 has entered its third round. One evaluation criterion is the ability of the candidate algorithm to be implemented on resource-constrained platforms. This includes FPGAs for embedded and hand-held devices. However, there has not been a comprehensive set of lightweight implementations for FPGAs reported to date.

All implementations were designed to achieve maximum throughput while adhering to an area constraint of 400-600 slices and one Block RAM on Xilinx Spartan-3 devices.

  abstract = {The CCA-secure lattice-based post-quantum key encapsulation scheme Saber is a candidate in the NIST's post-quantum cryptography standardization process. In this paper, we study the implementation aspects of Saber in resource-constrained microcontrollers from the ARM Cortex-M series which are very popular for realizing IoT applications. In this work, we carefully optimize various parts of Saber for speed and memory. We exploit digital signal processing instructions and efficient memory access for a fast implementation of polynomial multiplication. We also use memory efficient Karatsuba and just-in-time strategy for generating the public matrix of the module lattice to reduce the memory footprint. We also show that our optimizations can be combined with each other seamlessly to provide various speed-memory trade-offs. Our speed optimized software takes just 1,147K, 1,444K, and 1,543K clock cycles on a Cortex-M4 platform for key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation respectively. Our memory efficient software takes 4,786K, 6,328K, and 7,509K clock cycles on an ultra resource-constrained Cortex-M0 platform for key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation respectively while consuming only 6.2 KB of memory at most. These results show that lattice-based key encapsulation schemes are perfectly practical for securing IoT devices from quantum computing attacks.},

  abstract = {Sampling from a discrete Gaussian distribution is an indispensable part of lattice-based cryptography. Several recent works have shown that the timing leakage from a non-constant-time implementation of the discrete Gaussian sampling algorithm could be exploited to recover the secret. In this paper, we propose a constant-time implementation of the Knuth-Yao random walk algorithm for performing constant-time discrete Gaussian sampling. Since the random walk is dictated by a set of input random bits, we can express the generated sample as a function of the input random bits. Hence, our constant-time implementation expresses the unique mapping of the input random-bits to the output sample-bits as a Boolean expression of the random-bits. We use bit-slicing to generate multiple samples in batches and thus increase the throughput of our constant-time sampling manifold. Our experiments on an Intel i7-Broadwell processor show that our method can be as much as 2.4 times faster than the constant-time implementation of cumulative distribution table based sampling and consumes exponentially less memory than the Knuth-Yao algorithm with shuffling for a similar level of security.},

For reconfigurable hardware, the cumulative distribution table (CDT) scheme has previously been shown to achieve the highest throughput and the smallest resource utilisation, easily outperforming other existing samplers. However, the CDT sampler does not scale well. In fact, for large parameters, the lookup tables required are far too large to be practically implemented. This research proposes a hierarchy of multiple smaller samplers, extending the Gaussian convolution lemma to compute optimal parameters, where the individual samplers require much smaller lookup tables. A large range of parameter sets, covering encryption, signatures, and key exchange are evaluated. Hardware-optimised parameters are formulated and a practical implementation on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA device is realised. The proposed sampling designs demonstrate promising performance on reconfigurable hardware, even for large parameters, that were otherwise thought infeasible.},

  abstract = {The impending realization of scalable quantum computers will have a significant impact on today's security infrastructure. With the advent of powerful quantum computers public key cryptographic schemes will become vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm, undermining the security current communications systems. Post-quantum (or quantum-resistant) cryptography is an active research area, endeavoring to develop novel and quantum resistant public key cryptography. Amongst the various classes of quantum-resistant cryptography schemes, lattice-based cryptography is emerging as one of the most viable options. Its efficient implementation on software and on commodity hardware has already been shown to compete and even excel the performance of current classical security public-key schemes. This work discusses the next step in terms of their practical deployment, i.e., addressing the physical security of lattice-based cryptographic implementations. We survey the state-of-the-art in terms of side channel attacks (SCA), both invasive and passive attacks, and proposed countermeasures. Although the weaknesses exposed have led to countermeasures for these schemes, the cost, practicality and effectiveness of these on multiple implementation platforms, however, remains under-studied.},

We propose a hardware architecture for the modular multiplier that is based on our methods. The results show that, concerning the speed, our proposed architecture outperforms the modular multiplier based on standard modular multiplication for more than 50 \%.

Extensive previous work is available on how to reduce constant multiplications to additions, subtractions, and bit shifts. However, on previous work, only common two-input adders were used. As modern field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) support efficient ternary adders, i.e., adders with three inputs, this brief investigates constant multiplications that are built from ternary adders in an optimal way. The results show that the multiplication with any constant up to 22 bits can be realized by only three ternary adders. Average adder reductions of more than 33\% compared to optimal constant multiplication circuits using two-input adders are achieved for coefficient word sizes of more than five bits. Synthesis experiments show FPGA average slice reductions in the order of 25\% and a similar or higher speed than their two-input adder counterparts.},

  abstract = {Most lattice-based cryptographic schemes are built upon the assumed hardness of the Short Integer Solution (SIS) and Learning With Errors (LWE) problems. Their efficiencies can be drastically improved by switching the hardness assumptions to the more compact Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE problems. However, this change of hardness assumptions comes along with a possible security weakening: SIS and LWE are known to be at least as hard as standard (worst-case) problems on euclidean lattices, whereas Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE are only known to be as hard as their restrictions to special classes of ideal lattices, corresponding to ideals of some polynomial rings. In this work, we define the Module-SIS and Module-LWE problems, which bridge SIS with Ring-SIS, and LWE with Ring-LWE, respectively. We prove that these average-case problems are at least as hard as standard lattice problems restricted to module lattices (which themselves generalize arbitrary and ideal lattices). As these new problems enlarge the toolbox of the lattice-based cryptographer, they could prove useful for designing new schemes. Importantly, the worst-case to average-case reductions for the module problems are (qualitatively) sharp, in the sense that there exist converse reductions. This property is not known to hold in the context of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE: Ideal lattice problems could reveal easy without impacting the hardness of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE.},

There is, however, a lack of accurate and fast power and performance models of hardware components at such high levels of abstraction. In this paper, we present an approach that extends fast functional hardware models with the ability to produce detailed, cycle-level timing and power estimates. Our approach is based on back-annotating behavioral hardware descriptions with a dynamic power and performance model that allows capturing cycle-accurate and data-dependent activity without a significant loss in simulation speed. By integrating with existing high-level synthesis (HLS) flows, back-annotation is fully automated for custom hardware synthesized by HLS. We further leverage stateof-the-art machine learning techniques to synthesize abstract power models, where we introduce a structural decomposition technique to reduce model complexities and increase estimation accuracy. We have applied our back-annotation approach to several industrial-strength design examples under various architecture configurations. Results show that our models predict average power consumption to within 1\% and cycle-by-cycle power dissipation to within 10\% of a commercial gate-level power estimation tool, all while running several orders of magnitude faster.},

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography has shown great potential due to its resistance against quantum attacks. With the security requirements for high-precision Gaussian sampling and complex polynomial multiplication over rings, as well as storage of large public-keys, it is extremely challengeable but important to implement lattice-based schemes on resources constrained devices. In this paper, a resource-efficient and side-channel secure Ring-LWE cryptographic processor is presented. A discrete Gaussian sampler with constant response time, high precision, and large distribution tails is designed. The proposed Gaussian sampler is proven to be secure against side-channel timing attack according to the timing analysis attack results on a FPGA-based testing platform. A universal module MPE (Modular Processing Element) is designed to carry out all basic modular operations for Ring-LWE cryptography with high speed. The prototype verification is performed on the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA platform. The processor can execute an encryption/decryption operation on a 256-bit message in 4.5/0.9 ms whilst it consumes only 1307 LUTs, 889 FFs, 4 BRAMs, and none DSP module. Compared with other related hardware implementations, the Ring-LWE processor is advantageous not only in hardware efficiency but also in secure protection against side-channel attacks.},

We present two implementations of these algorithms: a portable C implementation and a high-speed implementation using assembly with AVX2 instructions. To demonstrate the improved efficiency in an application example, we benchmarked the algorithms in the context of the R-LWE key exchange protocol that has recently been proposed by Alkim, Ducas, Pöppelmann and Schwabe.

The number of cycles on a Skylake CPU of our constant-time AVX2 implementation of the scheme for key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation is approximatelyK,K, andK, which is more than 30X, 5X, and 8X faster than these respective procedures in the NTRU schemes that were submitted to the NIST post-quantum standardization process. These running times are also, by a large margin, smaller than those for all the other schemes in the NIST process. We also give a simple transformation that allows one to provably deal with small decryption errors in OW-CPA encryption schemes (such as NTRU) when using them to construct an IND-CCA2 key encapsulation.},

The modular arithmetic is important for a wide variety of computations in these devices, from communication to signal processing. To speed up some cryptographic operations, the most widespread devices often have some cryptographic support provided by a dedicated chip. Our goal is to use the resources of a crypto-coprocessor to accelerate general modular operations. The paper describes our implementation of modular arithmetic operations with large integers, and provides the comparison of the accelerated method with three classical methods for (modular) multiplication. The standard methods are represented by the operand-scanning multiplication algorithm (the school-book method), the product-scanning method (Comba's method) and the Montgomery multiplication. The accelerated method is based on using the RSA encryption support for multiplication tunnelling. The performance characteristics of standard methods and the advanced method called `RSA tunnel' are compared and concluded.},

  abstract = {Recent research in the field of lattice-based cryptography, especially on the topic of the ring-based primitive ring-LWE, provided efficient and practical ring-based cryptographic schemes, which can compete with more traditional number-theoretic ones. In the case of ring-LWE these cryptographic schemes operated mainly in power-of-two cyclotomics, which vastly restricted the variety of possible applications. Due to the toolkit for ring-LWE of Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev, there are now cryptographic schemes that operate in arbitrary cyclotomics, with no loss in their underlying hardness guarantees, and only little loss computational efficiency. Next to some further refinements and explanations of the theory and additional implementation notes, we provide the - as far as we know - first implementation of the toolkit of Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev. This includes a complete framework with fast and modular algorithms that can be used to build cryptographic schemes around ring-LWE. Our framework is easy to use, open source and has only little third party dependencies. For demonstration purposes we implemented two public-key cryptographic schemes using our framework. The complete source code is available at https://github.com/CMMayer/Toolkit-for-Ring-LWE.git.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an optimized FPGA implementation of a novel, fast and highly parallelized NTT-based polynomial multiplier architecture, which proves to be effective as an accelerator for lattice-based homomorphic cryptographic schemes. As input-output (I/O) operations are as time-consuming as NTT operations during homomorphic computations in a host processor/accelerator setting, instead of achieving the fastest NTT implementation possible on the target FPGA, we focus on a balanced time performance between the NTT and I/O operations. Even with this goal, we achieved the fastest NTT implementation in literature, to the best of our knowledge. For proof of concept, we utilize our architecture in a framework for Fan-Vercauteren (FV) homomorphic encryption scheme, utilizing a hardware/software co-design approach, in which NTT operations are offloaded to the accelerator while the rest of operations in the FV scheme are executed in software running on an off-the-shelf desktop computer. Specifically, our framework is optimized to accelerate Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library (SEAL), developed by the Cryptography Research Group at Microsoft Research [27], for the FV encryption scheme, where forward and inverse NTT operations are utilized extensively for large degree polynomial multiplications. The hardware part of the proposed framework targets XILINX VIRTEX7 FPGA device, which communicates with its software part via a PCIe connection. Offloading forward/inverse NTT and coefficient multiplication operations on FPGA, taking into account the time expended on I/O operations, the proposed framework achieves almost x11 latency speedup for the offloaded operations compared to their pure software implementations. With careful pipelining, overlapping I/O operations with actual polynomial multiplication computations, and assuming one of the operands for the polynomial multiplication operation is already inside the FPGA (valid assumption for encrypt/decrypt operations for homomorphic applications), we achieved a throughput of almost 800k polynomial multiplications per second, for polynomials of degree 1024 with 32-bit coefficients.},

  abstract = {Power side-channel attacks (SCAs) have become a major concern to the security community due to their noninvasive feature, low-cost, and effectiveness in extracting secret information from hardware implementation of cryto algorithms. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate if the hardware is vulnerable to SCAs during its design and validation stages. Currently, however, there is little known effort in evaluating the vulnerability of a hardware to SCAs at early design stage. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, an automated framework, named RTL-PSC, for power side-channel leakage assessment of hardware crypto designs at register-transfer level (RTL) with built-in evaluation metrics. RTL-PSC first estimates power profile of a hardware design using functional simulation at RTL. Then it utilizes the evaluation metrics, comprising of KL divergence metric and the success rate (SR) metric based on maximum likelihood estimation to perform power side-channel leakage (PSC) vulnerability assessment at RTL. We analyze GaloisField (GF) and Look-up Table (LUT) based AES designs using RTL-PSC and validate its effectiveness and accuracy through both gate-level simulation and FPGA results. RTL-PSC is also capable of identifying blocks∗ inside the design that contribute the most to the PSC vulnerability which can be used for efficient countermeasure implementation.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of dividing a two-word integer by a single-word integer, together with a few extensions and applications. Due to lack of efficient division instructions in current processors, the division is performed as a multiplication using a precomputed single-word approximation of the reciprocal of the divisor, followed by a couple of adjustment steps. There are three common types of unsigned multiplication instructions; we define full word multiplication (umul) which produces the two-word product of two single-word integers, low multiplication (umullo) which produces only the least significant word of the product, and high multiplication (umulhi), which produces only the most significant word. We describe an algorithm which produces a quotient and remainder using one umul and one umullo. This is an improvement over earlier methods, since the new method uses cheaper multiplication operations. It turns out we also get some additional savings from simpler adjustment conditions. The algorithm has been implemented in version 4.3 of the GMP library. When applied to the problem of dividing a large integer by a single word, the new algorithm gives a speedup of roughly 30\%, benchmarked on AMD and Intel processors in the x86 64 family.},

practices in computer security, specifically in applied cryptography, from theory to standardization to actual implementations. At
the same time, the emergence of new computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, software defined networks and Internet of
Everything, demands devices to adopt an increasing number of security standards - with a diverse set of cryptographic primitives.
This in turn calls for innovations in security beyond the foundational aspects, down to the actual design and deployment of such
primitives and protocols while satisfying conflicting design constraints such as latency, compactness, and energy efficiency.
The advent of Quantum computing threatens to break many classical cryptographic schemes, leading to innovations in public key
cryptography that focus on post-quantum cryptography primitives and their protocols that are resistant to quantum computing threats.
In particular, lattice-based cryptography is a promising post-quantum cryptography family, both in terms of foundational properties,
as well as its application to both traditional and emerging security problems such as encryption (asymmetric, but also symmetric),
digital signature, key exchange, homomorphic encryption etc. While such techniques provide guarantees in theory, their realization on
contemporary computing platforms requires careful design choices and tradeoffs to manage both the diversity of computing platforms
(e.g., high-performance to resource constrained), as well as agility for deployment in the face of emerging and changing standards.
In this work we survey trends in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some fundamental recent proposals for the use of lattices in

For real-world security applications assuming strong adversary models, a number of practical issues still need to be addressed. In this work we thus present an instance of ring-LWE encryption that is protected against active attacks (i.e., adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks) and equipped with countermeasures against side-channel analysis. Our solution is based on a postquantum variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform combined with provably secure first-order masking. To protect the key and message during decryption, we developed a masked binomial sampler that secures the re-encryption process required by FO. Our work shows that CCA2-secured RLWE-based encryption can be achieved with reasonable performance on constrained devices but also stresses that the required transformation and handling of decryption errors implies a performance overhead that has been overlooked by the community so far. With parameters providing 233 bits of quantum security, our implementation requires 4,176,684 cycles for encryption and 25,640,380 cycles for decryption with masking and hiding countermeasures on a Cortex-M4F. The first-order security of our masked implementation is also practically verified using the non-specific t-test evaluation methodology.},

We provide the up to our knowledge first fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA) implementation of NewHope-Simple that is a slight modification of NewHope proposed by the authors themselves in 2016. NewHope-Simple is basically NewHope with different error correction mechanism. Our implementation of the client-side scheme requires 1,483 slices, 4,498 look-up tables (LUTs), and 4,635 flip-flops (FFs) on low-cost Xilinx Artix-7 FPGAs. The implementation of the server-side scheme takes 1,708 slices, 5,142 LUTs, and 4,452 FFs. Both cores use only two digital signal processors (DSPs) and four 18-kb block memories (BRAMs). The implementation has a constant execution time to prevent timing attacks. The server-side operations take 1.4 milliseconds and the client-side operations take 1.5 milliseconds.},

Our solution is based on a post-quantum variant of the Fujisaki–Okamoto (FO) transform combined with provably secure, first-order masking. We show that CCA2-secured ring-LWE-based encryption can be achieved with reasonable performance on constrained devices but also stresses that the required transformation and handling of decryption errors implies an additional performance overhead that has not been considered so far.},

  abstract = {The messages in the latest security protocols such as IPSec, TLS and SSL must be handled by high-speed crypto systems. Current computationally extensive cryptographic implementations on different platforms such as software, Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) without adequate optimization achieve lesser throughput than should be possible. In the paper we consider a cryptographic hashing algorithm KECCAK and its implementations. To achieve better throughput, the proposed implementations of KECCAK explores FPGA design spaces. In this paper three different architectures for KECCAK coprocessor are implemented in Artix-7 (XC7A100T, CSG324) FPGA platform. The Processing Element (PE) handles all communication interfaces, data paths and control signals hazards of Network Security Processor (NSP). A partitioned area in the system ensures that the processor data path is completely isolated from secret key memory. The memory to KECCAK core communication is done by Direct Memory Access Controller (DMA). The performances of the implemented KECCAK are better in terms of throughput and resource usage than the existing work reported in the literature.},

Since Keccak has been selected as the winner of the NIST SHA-3 competition in 2012, there is the question of how far we can push the limits of Keccak to fulfill the stringent requirements of passive low-cost RFID. In this paper, we address this question by presenting a hardware implementation of Keccak that aims for lowest power and lowest area. Our smallest (fullstate) design requires only 2 927 GEs (for designs with external memory available) and 5 522 GEs (total size including memory). It has a power consumption of 12.5 µW at 1 MHz on a low leakage 130 nm CMOS process technology. As a result, we provide a design that needs 40 \% less resources than related work.

  abstract = {Single-trace side-channel attacks are a considerable threat to implementations of classic public-key schemes. For lattice-based cryptography, however, this class of attacks is much less understood, and only a small number of previous works show attacks. Primas et al., for instance, present a single-trace attack on the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), which is at the heart of many efficient lattice-based schemes.

They, however, attack a variable-time implementation and also require a rather powerful side-channel adversary capable of creating close to a million multivariate templates. Thus, it was an open question if such an attack can be made practical while also targeting state-of-the-art constant-time implementations.

In this paper, we answer this question positively. First, we introduce several improvements to the usage of belief propagation, which underlies the attack. And second, we change the target to encryption instead of decryption; this limits attacks to the recovery of the transmitted symmetric key, but in turn, increases attack performance. All this then allows successful attacks even when switching to univariate Hamming-weight templates. We evaluate the performance and noise resistance of our attack using simulations, but also target a real device. Concretely, we successfully attack an assembly-optimized constant-time Kyber implementation running on an ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller while requiring the construction of only 213 templates.},

  abstract = {In recent years lattice-based cryptography has emerged as quantum secure and theoretically elegant alternative to classical cryptographic schemes (like ECC or RSA). In addition to that, lattices are a versatile tool and play an important role in the development of efficient fully or somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE/FHE) schemes. In practice, ideal lattices defined in the polynomial ring ℤ p [x]/〈x n + 1〉 allow the reduction of the generally very large key sizes of lattice constructions. Another advantage of ideal lattices is that polynomial multiplication is a basic operation that has, in theory, only quasi-linear time complexity of (𝑛log𝑛)O(nlog⁡n)\{\textbackslash{}mathcal O\}(n \textbackslash{}log\{n\}) in ℤ p [x]/〈x n + 1〉. However, few is known about the practical performance of the FFT in this specific application domain and whether it is really an alternative. In this work we make a first step towards efficient FFT-based arithmetic for lattice-based cryptography and show that the FFT can be implemented efficiently on reconfigurable hardware. We give instantiations of recently proposed parameter sets for homomorphic and public-key encryption. In a generic setting we are able to multiply polynomials with up to 4096 coefficients and a 17-bit prime in less than 0.5 milliseconds. For a parameter set of a SHE scheme (n=1024,p=1061093377) our implementation performs 9063 polynomial multiplications per second on a mid-range Spartan-6.},

This unit can encrypt and decrypt a block in 26.19 µs and 16.80 µs on a Virtex-6 LX75T FPGA, respectively – at moderate resource requirements of about 1506 slices and a few block RAMs. Additionally, we provide solutions for several practical issues with Ring-LWE encryption, including the reduction of ciphertext expansion, error rate and constant-time operation.

But despite of promising constructions, only few results have been published on implementation issues on very constrained platforms. In this work we therefore study and compare implementations of Ring-LWE encryption and the bimodal lattice signature scheme (BLISS) on an 8-bit Atmel ATxmega128 microcontroller. Since the number theoretic transform (NTT) is one of the core components in implementations of lattice-based cryptosystems, we review the application of the NTT in previous implementations and present an improved approach that significantly lowers the runtime for polynomial multiplication. Our implementation of Ring-LWE encryption takes 27 ms for encryption and 6.7 ms for decryption. To compute a BLISS signature, our software takes 329 ms and 88 ms for verification. These results outperform implementations on similar platforms and underline the feasibility of lattice-based cryptography on constrained devices.},

  abstract = {Multipliers requiring large bit lengths have a major impact on the performance of many applications, such as cryptography, digital signal processing (DSP) and image processing. Novel, optimised designs of large integer multiplication are needed as previous approaches, such as schoolbook multiplication, may not be as feasible due to the large parameter sizes. Parameter bit lengths of up to millions of bits are required for use in cryptography, such as in lattice-based and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. This paper presents a comparison of hardware architectures for large integer multiplication. Several multiplication methods and combinations thereof are analysed for suitability in hardware designs, targeting the FPGA platform. In particular, the first hardware architecture combining Karatsuba and Comba multiplication is proposed. Moreover, a hardware complexity analysis is conducted to give results independent of any particular FPGA platform. It is shown that hardware designs of combination multipliers, at a cost of additional hardware resource usage, can offer lower latency compared to individual multiplier designs. Indeed, the proposed novel combination hardware design of the Karatsuba-Comba multiplier offers lowest latency for integers greater than 512 bits. For large multiplicands, greater than 16,384 bits, the hardware complexity analysis indicates that the NTT-Karatsuba-Schoolbook combination is most suitable.},

  abstract = {Data integrity is a key metric of security for Internet of Things (IoT) which refers to accuracy and reliability of data during transmission, storage and retrieval. Cryptographic hash functions are common means used for data integrity verification. Newly announced SHA-3 is the next generation hash function standard to replace existing SHA-1 and SHA-2 standards for better security. However, its underlying Keccak algorithm is computation intensive and thus limits its deployment on IoT systems which are normally equipped with 32-bit resource constrained embedded processors. This paper proposes two efficient SHA-3 ASIPs based on an open 32-bit RISC-V embedded processor named Z-scale. The first operation-oriented ASIP (OASIP) focuses on accelerating time-consuming operations with instruction set extensions to improve resource efficiency. And next datapath-oriented ASIP (DASIP) targets exploiting advance data and instruction level parallelism with extended auxiliary registers and customized datapath to achieve high performance. Implementation results show that both proposed ASIPs can effectively accelerate SHA-3 algorithm with 14.6\% and 26.9\% code size reductions, 30\% and 87\% resource efficiency improvements, 71\% and 262\% better maximum throughputs as well as 40\% and 288\% better power efficiencies than reference design.

  abstract = {In this article, we demonstrate practical side-channel assisted chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) over multiple CCA-secure lattice-based public-key encryption schemes (PKE) and key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEM). Most lattice-based PKE/KEMs suffer from the problem of decryption failures and some of these schemes use forward error correction codes to reduce the failure probability. These error correcting codes, when used within public-key cryptographic schemes, involve computations with secret components and hence might leak sensitive side-channel information. In this work, we identify a side-channel vulnerability in constant-time error correcting codes, which help the attacker distinguish between faulty and valid codewords through the EM/power side-channel information. We exploit the vulnerability to demonstrate a practical chosen-ciphertext attacks on the CCA-secure Round5 algorithm which uses timing attack resistant error correcting code.

We further identify a generic side-channel vulnerability within the CCA transformation steps used in multiple CCA-secure lattice-based PKE/KEM schemes. Exploiting the vulnerability, we demonstrate a practical chosen-ciphertext attack which can be performed on multiple CCA-secure lattice-based PKE/KEM schemes.

We perform experimental validation of our attacks using Electromagnetic measurements observed over optimized implementations of multiple NIST candidates taken from the pqm4 library, a benchmarking framework for post quantum cryptographic implementations for the ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. We thus establish that (1) lattice-based schemes that use error correcting codes, no matter constant-time or not, are vulnerable to power/EM side-channel attacks and (2) the notion that CCA-secure schemes are as insecure as their CPA-secure versions unless suitably masked against side-channel attacks.},

  abstract = {Power-based side channel attacks are a significant security risk, especially for embedded applications. To improve the security of such devices, protected logic styles have been proposed as an alternative to CMOS. However, they should only be used sparingly, since their area and power consumption are both significantly larger than for CMOS. In this paper, we propose to augment a processor, realized in CMOS, with custom instruction set extensions, realized in a protected logic, having both security and performance as the primary objectives. We have developed a design flow based on standard CAD tools that can automatically synthesize and place-and-route such hybrid implementations. The flow is integrated into a simulation and evaluation environment to quantify the security achieved on a sound basis. Using MCML logic as a case study, we have explored different partitions of the PRESENT block cipher between protected and unprotected logic. This experiment illustrates the tradeoff between the type and amount of application-level functionality implemented in protected logic and the level of security achieved by the design. Our approach and evaluation tools are generic and could be used to partition any algorithm using any protected logic style.},

  abstract = {Variability is a central issue in deep submicron technologies, in which it becomes increasingly difficult to produce two chips with the same behavior. While the impact of variability is well understood from the microelectronic point of view, very few works investigated its significance for cryptographic implementations. This is an important concern as 65-nanometer and smaller technologies are soon going to equip an increasing number of security-enabled devices. Based on measurements performed on 20 prototype chips of an AES S-box, this paper provides the first comprehensive treatment of variability issues for side-channel attacks. We show that technology scaling implies important changes in terms of physical security. First, common leakage models (e.g. based on the Hamming weight of the manipulated data) are no longer valid as the size of transistors shrinks, even for standard CMOS circuits. This impacts both the evaluation of hardware countermeasures and formal works assuming that independent computations lead to independent leakage. Second, we discuss the consequences of variability for profiled side-channel attacks. We study the extend to which a leakage model that is carefully profiled for one device can lead to successful attacks against another device. We also define the perceived information to quantify this context, which generalizes the notion of mutual information with possibly degraded leakage models. Our results exhibit that existing side-channel attacks are not perfectly suited to this new context. They constitute an important step in better understanding the challenges raised by future technologies for the theory and practice of leakage resilient cryptography.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a masking scheme to protect ring-LWE decryption from first-order side-channel attacks. In an unprotected ring-LWE decryption, the recovered plaintext is computed by first performing polynomial arithmetic on the secret key and then decoding the result. We mask the polynomial operations by arithmetically splitting the secret key polynomial into two random shares; the final decoding operation is performed using a new bespoke masked decoder. The outputs of our masked ring-LWE decryption are Boolean shares suitable for derivation of a symmetric key. Thus, the masking scheme keeps all intermediates, including the recovered plaintext, in the masked domain. We have implemented the masking scheme on both hardware and software.

The toolbox, called RamDPA and developed in C++, is flexible and modular and has been initially designed to carry out differential power analysis attacks. Different modules are used to enter text, keys, and hypothetical values related to the cryptographic algorithm under analysis, to control the digital oscilloscope in charge of the acquisition of power consumption traces, and to carry out the statistical operations to get the unknown key. An analysis of the different options to program the modules has been performed in order to optimize the toolbox in terms of memory consumption and execution time. Usually, the optimization of side-channel attacks comes from the selection of points-of-interest and re-sampling. Instead of that approach, the proposed toolbox optimizes DPA attacks from caching strategy and multithreading. Results are presented by applying RamDPA to extract an AES-128 key with the traces provided by the CHES2016 capture The Flag challenge.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose an efficient and compact processor for a ring-LWE based encryption scheme. We present three optimizations for the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) used for polynomial multiplication: we avoid preprocessing in the negative wrapped convolution by merging it with the main algorithm, we reduce the fixed computation cost of the twiddle factors and propose an advanced memory access scheme. These optimization techniques reduce both the cycle and memory requirements. Finally, we also propose an optimization of the ring-LWE encryption system that reduces the number of NTT operations from five to four resulting in a 20\% speed-up. We use these computational optimizations along with several architectural optimizations to design an instruction-set ring-LWE cryptoprocessor. For dimension 256, our processor performs encryption/decryption operations in 20/9 µs on a Virtex 6 FPGA and only requires 1349 LUTs, 860 FFs, 1 DSP-MULT and 2 BRAMs. Similarly for dimension 512, the processor takes 48/21 µs for performing encryption/decryption operations and only requires 1536 LUTs, 953 FFs, 1 DSP-MULT and 3 BRAMs. Our processors are therefore more than three times smaller than the current state of the art hardware implementations, whilst running somewhat faster.},

We first describe a secure Diffie-Hellman type key exchange protocol, which is then transformed into an IND-CPA encryption scheme and finally into an IND-CCA secure key encapsulation mechanism using a post-quantum version of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform. The design goals of this package were simplicity, efficiency and flexibility resulting in the following choices: all integer moduli are powers ofavoiding modular reduction and rejection sampling entirely; the use of LWR halves the amount of randomness required compared to LWE-based schemes and reduces bandwidth; the module structure provides flexibility by reusing one core component for multiple security levels. A constant-time AVX2 optimized software implementation of the KEM with parameters providing more than 128 bits of post-quantum security, requires only 101K, 125K and 129K cycles for key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation respectively on a Dell laptop with an Intel i7-Haswell processor.},

  abstract = {We describe new arithmetic coding techniques and side-channel blinding countermeasures for lattice-based cryptography. Using these techniques, we develop a practical, compact, and more quantum-resistant variant of the BLISS Ideal Lattice Signature Scheme. We first show how the BLISS parameters and hash-based random oracle can be modified to be more secure against quantum pre-image attacks while optimizing signature size. Arithmetic Coding offers an information theoretically optimal compression for stationary and memoryless sources, such as the discrete Gaussian distributions often present in lattice-based cryptography. We show that this technique gives better signature sizes than the previously proposed advanced Huffman-based signature compressors. We further demonstrate that arithmetic decoding from an uniform source to target distribution is also an optimal non-uniform sampling method in the sense that a minimal amount of true random bits is required. Performance of this new Binary Arithmetic Coding sampler is comparable to other practical samplers. The same code, tables, or circuitry can be utilized for both tasks, eliminating the need for separate sampling and compression components. We then describe simple randomized blinding techniques that can be applied to anti-cyclic polynomial multiplication to mask timing- and power consumption side-channels in ring arithmetic. We further show that the Gaussian sampling process can also be blinded by a split-and-permute techniques as an effective countermeasure against side-channel attacks.},

Our implementation supports two representative parameter sets, ees1087ep1 and ees1499ep1, optimized for speed, which provide security levels of 192 and 256 bits, respectively. Our implementation follows an earlier proposed Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Hardware Application Programming Interface (API), which facilitates its fair comparison with implementations of other PQC schemes, especially those submitted for consideration in the NIST PQC standardization process. The paper contains the detailed flow and block diagrams, timing analysis, as well as results in terms of latency (in clock cycles), maximum clock frequency, and resource utilization in modern high-performance Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Our implementation has demonstrated a hash function bottleneck caused by the sequential nature of SHA-2, as compared to the ability of concurrent execution of multiple lower-level operations during a polynomial multiplication. In order to address this bottleneck, we have proposed the use of a pseudorandom function based on the pipelined AES. Additionally, we have also suggested a method for eliminating the dependence of the execution time on the message size. Our code is intended to be made open-source to speed-up further design-space exploration and benchmarking on multiple hardware platforms.},

  abstract = {Models and tools developed by the semiconductor community have matured over decades of use. As a result, hardware simulations can yield highly accurate and easily automated pre-silicon estimates for e.g. timing and area figures. In this work we design, implement, and evaluate CASCADE, a framework that combines a largely automated full-stack standard-cell design flow with the state of the art techniques for side channel analysis. We show how it can be used to efficiently evaluate side channel leakage prior to chip manufacturing. Moreover, it is independent of the underlying countermeasure and it can be applied starting from the earliest stages of the design flow. Additionally, we provide experimental validation through assessment of the side channel security of representative cryptographic circuits. We discuss aspects related to the performance, scalability, and utility to the designers. In particular, we show that CASCADE can evaluate information leakage with 1 million simulated traces in less than 4 hours using a single desktop workstation, for a design larger than 100kGE.},

  abstract = {Post-quantum cryptographic schemes have been developed in the last decade in response to the rise of quantum computers. Fortunately, several schemes have been developed with quantum resistance. However, there is very little effort in evaluating and comparing these schemes in the embedded settings. Low cost embedded devices represents a highly-constraint environment that challenges all post-quantum cryptographic schemes. Moreover, there are even fewer efforts in evaluating the security of these schemes against implementation attacks including side-channel and fault attacks. It is commonly accepted that, any embedded cryptographic module that is built without a sound countermeasure, can be easily broken. Therefore, we investigate the question: Are we ready to implement post-quantum cryptographic schemes on embedded systems? We present an exhaustive survey of research efforts in designing embedded modules of post-quantum cryptographic schemes and the efforts in securing these modules against implementation attacks. Unfortunately, the study shows that: we are not ready yet to implement any post-quantum cryptographic scheme in practical embedded systems. There is still a considerable amount of research that needs to be conducted before reaching a satisfactory level of security.},

Microprocessors and microcontrollers which include suitable countermeasures can be a vital building block for such systems. In this paper, we present a detailed concept for building embedded processors with SCA countermeasures. Our concept is based on ideas for the secure implementation of cryptographic instruction set extensions. On the one hand, it draws from known SCA countermeasures like DPA-resistant logic styles. On the other hand, our protection scheme is geared towards use in modern embedded applications like PDAs and smart phones. It supports multitasking and a separation of secure system software and (potentially insecure) user applications. Furthermore, our concept affords support for a wide range of cryptographic algorithms. Based on this concept, embedded processor cores with support for a selected set of cryptographic algorithms can be built using a fully automated design flow.},

The PKC-based security protocols are more energy-efficient because they usually require less communication overhead than symmetric-key-based counterparts. In this work, we propose the first-of-its-kind tri-mode PKC coprocessor for secured data transmission in Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. For the purpose of low energy consumption, the crypto-coprocessor incorporates three design features, including 1) specialized instruction set for the multi-mode cryptosystems, 2) a highly parallel arithmetic unit for cryptographic kernel operations, and 3) a smart scheduling unit with intelligent control mechanism. By utilizing the parallel arithmetic unit, the proposed crypto-coprocessor can achieve about 50\% speed up. Meanwhile, the smart scheduling unit can save up to 18\% of the total latency. The crypto-coprocessor was implemented with AHB interface in TSMC 90nm CMOS technology, and the die size is only 1.96 mm\textsuperscript{2}. Furthermore, our chip is integrated with an ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) platform for functional verification.},

The parametrized generator demonstrates automatic parameter-dependent test generation and seamless system integration. An analysis of FFT scheduling is performed to show how various mathematical properties of the Cooley-Tukey FFT decomposition may be exploited to simplify needed hardware while assuring conflict-free bank accesses for every operation. The resulting circuit throughput, energy, and area are shown to be better than or on par with other FFT generators.},

Our fundamental contribution for this purpose is to change the way of expressing the problem, from the system of equations used in algebraic attacks to a code, essentially inspired by low density parity check codes. We then show that such codes can be efficiently decoded, taking advantage of the sparsity of the information corresponding to intermediate variables in actual leakage traces. The resulting soft analytical side-channel attacks work under the same profiling assumptions as template attacks, and directly exploit the vectors of probabilities produced by these attacks. As a result, we bridge the gap between popular side-channel distinguishers based on simple statistical tests and previous approaches to analytical side-channel attacks that could only exploit hard information so far.},

  abstract = {Power and energy consumption is a major issue and a design constraint in many types of systems. However, the knowledge of average power consumption is not enough, since many issues may arise due to dynamic power characteristics, such as IR drop, and side channel attacks in cryptographic circuits via DPA. Analog simulation (e.g. Spice), which has been used for decades as an accurate mean for estimating current and power, is no longer an option when it comes to medium to large circuits, due to the unacceptable simulation time. This paper presents an open framework for fast and accurate dynamic power estimation based on gate-level simulation, and standard tools and libraries. Our solution was thoroughly evaluated using standard benchmark and cryptographic circuits. Relevant speed and accuracy measures were compared to the ones obtained with analog simulation, such as speed-up, peak and average power, and cross correlation. A comparison with other published solutions was conducted, when possible. Our solution achieved a speed-up of three orders of magnitude in simulation time as compared to analog simulation, which is one order of magnitude better than other published solutions. The results, such as average and peak power and correlation, are in the same range as the published solutions. When applied to cryptographic circuits our solution has shown similar results to benchmark circuits indicating a feasible solution for DPA evaluation usage. Our solution is totally based on standard simulators and libraries. It is fully open and it has disclosed documentation and code, available for public use.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an FPGA implementation of the Niederreiter cryptosystem using binary Goppa codes, including modules for encryption, decryption, and key generation. We improve over previous implementations in terms of efficiency (time-area product and raw performance) and security level. Our implementation is constant time in order to protect against timing side-channel analysis. The design is fully parameterized, using code-generation scripts, in order to support a wide range of parameter choices for security, including binary field size, the degree of the Goppa polynomial, and the code length. The parameterized design allows us to choose design parameters for time-area trade-offs in order to support a wide variety of applications ranging from smart cards to server accelerators. For parameters that are considered to provide “128-bit post-quantum security”, our time-optimized implementation requires 966,400 cycles for the generation of both public and private portions of a key and 14,291 cycles to decrypt a ciphertext. The time-optimized design uses only 121,806 ALMs (52\% of the available logic) and 961 RAM blocks (38\% of the available memory), and results in a design that runs at about 250 MHz on a medium-size Stratix V FPGA.},
