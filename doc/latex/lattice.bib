  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography is the generic term for constructions of cryptographic primitives that involve lattices, either in the construction itself or in the security proof. Lattice-based constructions are currently important candidates for post-quantum cryptography.  Unlike more widely used and known public-key schemes such as the RSA, Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic-Curve cryptosystems, which are easily attacked by a quantum computer, some lattice-based constructions appear to be resistant to attack by both classical and quantum computers. Furthermore, many lattice-based constructions are known to be secure under the assumption that certain well-studied computational lattice problems cannot be solved efficiently.},

  abstract = {Advances in computing steadily erode computer security at its foundation, and call for fundamental innovations to strengthen current
practices in computer security, specifically in applied cryptography, from theory to standardization to actual implementations. At
the same time, the emergence of new computing paradigms, such as cloud computing, software defined networks and Internet of
Everything, demands devices to adopt an increasing number of security standards - with a diverse set of cryptographic primitives.
This in turn calls for innovations in security beyond the foundational aspects, down to the actual design and deployment of such
primitives and protocols while satisfying conflicting design constraints such as latency, compactness, and energy efficiency.
The advent of Quantum computing threatens to break many classical cryptographic schemes, leading to innovations in public key
cryptography that focus on post-quantum cryptography primitives and their protocols that are resistant to quantum computing threats.
In particular, lattice-based cryptography is a promising post-quantum cryptography family, both in terms of foundational properties,
as well as its application to both traditional and emerging security problems such as encryption (asymmetric, but also symmetric),
digital signature, key exchange, homomorphic encryption etc. While such techniques provide guarantees in theory, their realization on
contemporary computing platforms requires careful design choices and tradeoffs to manage both the diversity of computing platforms
(e.g., high-performance to resource constrained), as well as agility for deployment in the face of emerging and changing standards.
In this work we survey trends in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some fundamental recent proposals for the use of lattices in
computer security, challenges for their implementation in software and hardware, and emerging needs for their adoption.},

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography has gained credence recently as a replacement for current public-key cryptosystems, due to its quantum-resilience, versatility, and relatively low key sizes. To date, encryption based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem has only been investigated from an ideal lattice standpoint, due to its computation and size efficiencies. However, a thorough investigation of standard lattices in practice has yet to be considered. Standard lattices may be preferred to ideal lattices due to their stronger security assumptions and less restrictive parameter selection process. In this paper, an area-optimised hardware architecture of a standard lattice-based cryptographic scheme is proposed. The design is implemented on a FPGA and it is found that both encryption and decryption fit comfortably on a Spartan-6 FPGA. This is the first hardware architecture for standard lattice-based cryptography reported in the literature to date, and thus is a benchmark for future implementations. Additionally, a revised discrete Gaussian sampler is proposed which is the fastest of its type to date, and also is the first to investigate the cost savings of implementing with λ/2-bits of precision. Performance results are promising compared to the hardware designs of the equivalent ring-LWE scheme, which in addition to providing stronger security proofs; generate 1272 encryptions per second and 4395 decryptions per second.},

So far it is known for solid security reductions but implementations of specific instances have often been reported to be too complex beyond any practicability. In this work, we present an efficient and scalable micro-code engine for Ring-LWE encryption that combines polynomial multiplication based on the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), polynomial addition, subtraction, and Gaussian sampling in a single unit. This unit can encrypt and decrypt a block in 26.19 µs and 16.80 µs on a Virtex-6 LX75T FPGA, respectively – at moderate resource requirements of about 1506 slices and a few block RAMs. Additionally, we provide solutions for several practical issues with Ring-LWE encryption, including the reduction of ciphertext expansion, error rate and constant-time operation. We hope that this contribution helps to pave the way for the deployment of ideal lattice-based encryption in future real-world systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the implementation of a multi-mode crypto-coprocessor, which can support three different public-key cryptography (PKC) engines (NTRU, TTS, Pairing) used in post-quantum and identity-based cryptosystems. The PKC-based security protocols are more energy-efficient because they usually require less communication overhead than symmetric-key-based counterparts. In this work, we propose the first-of-its-kind tri-mode PKC coprocessor for secured data transmission in Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. For the purpose of low energy consumption, the crypto-coprocessor incorporates three design features, including 1) specialized instruction set for the multi-mode cryptosystems, 2) a highly parallel arithmetic unit for cryptographic kernel operations, and 3) a smart scheduling unit with intelligent control mechanism. By utilizing the parallel arithmetic unit, the proposed crypto-coprocessor can achieve about 50\% speed up. Meanwhile, the smart scheduling unit can save up to 18\% of the total latency. The crypto-coprocessor was implemented with AHB interface in TSMC 90nm CMOS technology, and the die size is only 1.96 mm\textsuperscript{2}. Furthermore, our chip is integrated with an ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) platform for functional verification.},

As a consequence, the appearance of quantum computers or algorithmic advances on these problems may lead to the unpleasant situation that a large number of today's schemes will most likely need to be replaced with more secure alternatives. In this work we present such an alternative-an efficient signature scheme whose security is derived from the hardness of lattice problems. It is based on recent theoretical advances in lattice-based cryptography and is highly optimized for practicability and use in embedded systems. The public and secret keys are roughly 1.5 kB and 0.3 kB long, while the signature size is approximately 1.1 kB for a security level of around 80 bits. We provide implementation results on reconfigurable hardware (Spartan/Virtex-6) and demonstrate that the scheme is scalable, has low area consumption, and even outperforms classical schemes.},

The encryption uses an implementation-friendly Binary-Ring-Learning-with-Errors (B-RLWE) problem with binary errors that can be efficiently generated in hardware. We demonstrate that a direct implementation of B-RLWE exhibits vulnerability to power side-channel attacks, even to Simple Power Analysis, due to the nature of binary coefficients. We mitigate this vulnerability with a redundant addition and memory update. To further protect against Differential Power Analysis (DPA), we use a B-RLWE specific opportunity to construct a lightweight yet effective countermeasure based on randomization of intermediate states and masked threshold decoding. On a SAKURA-G FPGA board, we show that our method increases the required number of measurements for DPA attacks by 40 χ compared to unprotected design. Our results also quantify the trade-off between side-channel security and hardware area-cost of B-RLWE.},

Finally, we also propose an optimization of the ring-LWE encryption system that reduces the number of NTT operations from ﬁve to four resulting in a 20\% speed-up. We use these computational optimizations along with several architectural optimizations to design an instruction-set ring-LWE cryptoprocessor. For dimension 256, our processor performs encryption/decryption operations in 20/9 µs on a Virtex 6 FPGA and only requires 1349 LUTs, 860 FFs, 1 DSP-MULT and 2 BRAMs. Similarly for dimension 512, the processor takes 48/21 µs for performing encryption/decryption operations and only requires 1536 LUTs, 953 FFs, 1 DSP-MULT and 3 BRAMs. Our processors are therefore more than three times smaller than the current state of the art hardware implementations, whilst running somewhat faster.},

In order to reduce the cost of bit-reverse operation, a optimization technique is introduced to perform it on-the-fly. We also present a technique to improve the utilization rate of the butterfly operator. Moreover, the cancellation lemma is exploited to reduce the required ROM storage.

At the same time, the emergence of new computing paradigms, such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Everything, demand that innovations in security extend beyond their foundational aspects, to the actual design and deployment of these primitives and protocols while satisfying emerging design constraints such as latency, compactness, energy efficiency, and agility. While many alternatives have been proposed for symmetric key cryptography and related protocols (e.g., lightweight ciphers and authenticated encryption), the alternatives for public key cryptography are limited to post-quantum cryptography primitives and their protocols. In particular, lattice-based cryptography is a promising candidate, both in terms of foundational properties, as well as its application to traditional security problems such as key exchange, digital signature, and encryption/decryption. We summarize trends in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some fundamental recent proposals for the use of lattices in computer security, challenges for their implementation in software and hardware, and emerging needs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an FPGA implementation of the Niederreiter cryptosystem using binary Goppa codes, including modules for encryption, decryption, and key generation. We improve over previous implementations in terms of efficiency (time-area product and raw performance) and security level. Our implementation is constant time in order to protect against timing side-channel analysis. The design is fully parameterized, using code-generation scripts, in order to support a wide range of parameter choices for security, including binary field size, the degree of the Goppa polynomial, and the code length. The parameterized design allows us to choose design parameters for time-area trade-offs in order to support a wide variety of applications ranging from smart cards to server accelerators. For parameters that are considered to provide “128-bit post-quantum security”, our time-optimized implementation requires 966,400 cycles for the generation of both public and private portions of a key and 14,291 cycles to decrypt a ciphertext. The time-optimized design uses only 121,806 ALMs (52\% of the available logic) and 961 RAM blocks (38\% of the available memory), and results in a design that runs at about 250 MHz on a medium-size Stratix V FPGA.},

  abstract = {Ciphertext indistinguishability is a property of many encryption schemes. Intuitively, if a cryptosystem possesses the property of indistinguishability, then an adversary will be unable to distinguish pairs of ciphertexts based on the message they encrypt. The property of indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is considered a basic requirement for most provably secure public key cryptosystems, though some schemes also provide indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. Indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is equivalent to the property of semantic security, and many cryptographic proofs use these definitions interchangeably.
A cryptosystem is considered secure in terms of indistinguishability if no adversary, given an encryption of a message randomly chosen from a two-element message space determined by the adversary, can identify the message choice with probability significantly better than that of random guessing (\mbox{}1⁄2). If any adversary can succeed in distinguishing the chosen ciphertext with a probability significantly greater than \mbox{}1⁄2, then this adversary is considered to have an "advantage" in distinguishing the ciphertext, and the scheme is not considered secure in terms of indistinguishability. This definition encompasses the notion that in a secure scheme, the adversary should learn no information from seeing a ciphertext. Therefore, the adversary should be able to do no better than if it guessed randomly.},

This work helps in assessing the practicality of lattice-based encryption. For the software implementation, we give a comparison between a matrix and polynomial based variant of the LWE scheme. This module includes multiplication in polynomial rings using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In order to implement lattice-based cryptography in an efficient way, it is crucial to apply the systems over polynomial rings. FFT speeds up multiplication in polynomial rings, which is the most critical operation in lattice-based cryptography, from quadratic to quasi-linear runtime. For the hardware variant, we show how this fundamental building block of lattice-based cryptography can be implemented and evaluated in terms of performance. A second important component for lattice-based cryptosystems is the sampling from discrete Gaussian distributions. We examine three different variants for sampling Gaussian distributed integers, namely rejection sampling, a rounding based approach, and a look-up table based approach in hardware.},

Our implementation supports two representative parameter sets, ees1087ep1 and ees1499ep1, optimized for speed, which provide security levels of 192 and 256 bits, respectively. Our implementation follows an earlier proposed Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Hardware Application Programming Interface (API), which facilitates its fair comparison with implementations of other PQC schemes, especially those submitted for consideration in the NIST PQC standardization process. The paper contains the detailed flow and block diagrams, timing analysis, as well as results in terms of latency (in clock cycles), maximum clock frequency, and resource utilization in modern high-performance Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Our implementation has demonstrated a hash function bottleneck caused by the sequential nature of SHA-2, as compared to the ability of concurrent execution of multiple lower-level operations during a polynomial multiplication. In order to address this bottleneck, we have proposed the use of a pseudorandom function based on the pipelined AES. Additionally, we have also suggested a method for eliminating the dependence of the execution time on the message size. Our code is intended to be made open-source to speed-up further design-space exploration and benchmarking on multiple hardware platforms.},

Although various fields of human activity, such as chemistry, medicine, and materials science, are likely to be dramatically affected by practical quantum computers, the most likely immediate impact will take place in the area of cryptography and cyber security. As a result of this potential threat, a new field of science has emerged, called Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). PQC is devoted to the design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant against any known attacks using quantum computers, but by themselves can be implemented using classical computing platforms, based on traditional modern semiconductor technologies. In this paper, we provide an overview and motivation for the PQC, NIST Standardization Effort, cryptographic competitions, and hardware benchmarking of candidates in cryptographic contests. Five major families of PQC schemes, code-, hash-, isogeny-, lattice-, and multivariate-based, are shortly introduced. The challenges of fair and comprehensive hardware benchmarking of PQC submissions are highlighted, together with the possible ways of overcoming these difficulties, such as the use of a common API, development packages, specialized libraries, and high-level synthesis.},

These solutions must be secure against classical and post-quantum cryptanalysis techniques as well as feasible for all kinds of devices, including energy-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The quantum immunity can be implemented in the cryptographic layer, e.g., by using recent lattice-based key exchange algorithms NewHope or Frodo, or in the physical layer of wireless communication, by utilizing eavesdropping-resistant secrecy coding techniques. In this study, we explore and compare the feasibility and energy efﬁciency of selected cryptographic layer and physical layer approaches by applying an evaluation approach that is based on simulation and modeling. In particular, we consider NewHope and Frodo key exchange algorithms as well as novel physical layer secrecy coding approach that is based on polar codes. The results reveal that our proposed physical layer implementation is very competitive with respect to the cryptographic solutions, particularly in short-range wireless communication. We also observed that the total energy consumption is unequally divided between transmitting and receiving devices in all the studied approaches. This may be an advantage when designing security architectures for energy-restricted devices.},

  abstract = {Post-quantum cryptographic schemes have been developed in the last decade in response to the rise of quantum computers. Fortunately, several schemes have been developed with quantum resistance. However, there is very little effort in evaluating and comparing these schemes in the embedded settings. Low cost embedded devices represents a highly-constraint environment that challenges all post-quantum cryptographic schemes. Moreover, there are even fewer efforts in evaluating the security of these schemes against implementation attacks including side-channel and fault attacks. It is commonly accepted that, any embedded cryptographic module that is built without a sound countermeasure, can be easily broken. Therefore, we investigate the question: Are we ready to implement post-quantum cryptographic schemes on embedded systems? We present an exhaustive survey of research efforts in designing embedded modules of post-quantum cryptographic schemes and the efforts in securing these modules against implementation attacks. Unfortunately, the study shows that: we are not ready yet to implement any post-quantum cryptographic scheme in practical embedded systems. There is still a considerable amount of research that needs to be conducted before reaching a satisfactory level of security.},

  abstract = {Multipliers requiring large bit lengths have a major impact on the performance of many applications, such as cryptography, digital signal processing (DSP) and image processing. Novel, optimised designs of large integer multiplication are needed as previous approaches, such as schoolbook multiplication, may not be as feasible due to the large parameter sizes. Parameter bit lengths of up to millions of bits are required for use in cryptography, such as in lattice-based and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. This paper presents a comparison of hardware architectures for large integer multiplication. Several multiplication methods and combinations thereof are analysed for suitability in hardware designs, targeting the FPGA platform. In particular, the first hardware architecture combining Karatsuba and Comba multiplication is proposed. Moreover, a hardware complexity analysis is conducted to give results independent of any particular FPGA platform. It is shown that hardware designs of combination multipliers, at a cost of additional hardware resource usage, can offer lower latency compared to individual multiplier designs. Indeed, the proposed novel combination hardware design of the Karatsuba-Comba multiplier offers lowest latency for integers greater than 512 bits. For large multiplicands, greater than 16,384 bits, the hardware complexity analysis indicates that the NTT-Karatsuba-Schoolbook combination is most suitable.},

In the case of ring-LWE these cryptographic schemes operated mainly in power-of-two cyclotomics, which vastly restricted the variety of possible applications. Due to the toolkit for ring-LWE of Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev, there are now cryptographic schemes that operate in arbitrary cyclotomics, with no loss in their underlying hardness guarantees, and only little loss computational efficiency. Next to some further refinements and explanations of the theory and additional implementation notes, we provide the - as far as we know - first implementation of the toolkit of Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev. This includes a complete framework with fast and modular algorithms that can be used to build cryptographic schemes around ring-LWE. Our framework is easy to use, open source and has only little third party dependencies. For demonstration purposes we implemented two public-key cryptographic schemes using our framework.

This module includes multiplication in polynomial rings using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In order to implement lattice-based cryptography in an efficient way, it is crucial to apply the systems over polynomial rings. FFT speeds up multiplication in polynomial rings, which is the most critical operation in lattice-based cryptography, from quadratic to quasi-linear runtime. For the hardware variant, we show how this fundamental building block of lattice-based cryptography can be implemented and evaluated in terms of performance. A second important component for lattice-based cryptosystems is the sampling from discrete Gaussian distributions. We examine three different variants for sampling Gaussian distributed integers, namely rejection sampling, a rounding based approach, and a look-up table based approach in hardware.},

In this work we revisit their instantiation and stand-alone implementation. Speciﬁcally, we propose new parameters and a better suited error distribution, analyze the scheme’s hardness against attacks by quantum computers in a conservative way, introduce a new and more efﬁcient error-reconciliation mechanism, and propose a defense against backdoors and all-for-the-price-of-one attacks. By these measures and for the same lattice dimension, we more than double the security parameter, halve the communication overhead, and speed up computation by more than a factor of 8 in a portable C implementation and by more than a factor of 27 in an optimized implementation targeting current Intel CPUs. These speedups are achieved with comprehensive protection against timing attacks.},

  abstract = {During the last years public-key encryption schemes based on the hardness of ring-LWE have gained significant popularity. For real-world security applications assuming strong adversary models, a number of practical issues still need to be addressed. In this work we thus present an instance of ring-LWE encryption that is protected against active attacks (i.e., adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks) and equipped with countermeasures against side-channel analysis. Our solution is based on a postquantum variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform combined with provably secure first-order masking. To protect the key and message during decryption, we developed a masked binomial sampler that secures the re-encryption process required by FO. Our work shows that CCA2-secured RLWE-based encryption can be achieved with reasonable performance on constrained devices but also stresses that the required transformation and handling of decryption errors implies a performance overhead that has been overlooked by the community so far. With parameters providing 233 bits of quantum security, our implementation requires 4,176,684 cycles for encryption and 25,640,380 cycles for decryption with masking and hiding countermeasures on a Cortex-M4F. The first-order security of our masked implementation is also practically verified using the non-specific t-test evaluation methodology.},

With the advent of powerful quantum computers public key cryptographic schemes will become vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm, undermining the security current communications systems. Post-quantum (or quantum-resistant) cryptography is an active research area, endeavoring to develop novel and quantum resistant public key cryptography. Amongst the various classes of quantum-resistant cryptography schemes, lattice-based cryptography is emerging as one of the most viable options. Its efficient implementation on software and on commodity hardware has already been shown to compete and even excel the performance of current classical security public-key schemes. This work discusses the next step in terms of their practical deployment, i.e., addressing the physical security of lattice-based cryptographic implementations. We survey the state-of-the-art in terms of side channel attacks (SCA), both invasive and passive attacks, and proposed countermeasures. Although the weaknesses exposed have led to countermeasures for these schemes, the cost, practicality and effectiveness of these on multiple implementation platforms, however, remains under-studied.},

In an unprotected ring-LWE decryption, the recovered plaintext is computed by first performing polynomial arithmetic on the secret key and then decoding the result. We mask the polynomial operations by arithmetically splitting the secret key polynomial into two random shares; the final decoding operation is performed using a new bespoke masked decoder. The outputs of our masked ring-LWE decryption are Boolean shares suitable for derivation of a symmetric key. Thus, the masking scheme keeps all intermediates, including the recovered plaintext, in the masked domain. We have implemented the masking scheme on both hardware and software. On a Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA, the masked ring-LWE processor requires around 2000 LUTs, a 20 \%20 \%20\textasciitilde$\backslash$\% increase in the area with respect to the unprotected architecture. A masked decryption operation takes 7478 cycles, which is only a factor 2.6×2.6×2.6$\backslash$times larger than the unprotected decryption.

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography is one of the most promising branches of quantum resilient cryptography, offering versatility and efficiency. Discrete Gaussian samplers are a core building block in most, if not all, lattice-based cryptosystems, and optimised samplers are desirable both for high-speed and low-area applications. Due to the inherent structure of existing discrete Gaussian sampling methods, lattice-based cryptosystems are vulnerable to side-channel attacks, such as timing analysis. In this paper, the first comprehensive evaluation of discrete Gaussian samplers in hardware is presented, targeting FPGA devices. Novel optimised discrete Gaussian sampler hardware architectures are proposed for the main sampling techniques. An independent-time design of each of the samplers is presented, offering security against side-channel timing attacks, including the first proposed constant-time Bernoulli, KnuthYao, and discrete Ziggurat sampler hardware designs. For a balanced performance, the Cumulative Distribution Table (CDT) sampler is recommended, with the proposed hardware CDT design achieving a throughput of 59.4 million samples per second for encryption, utilising just 43 slices on a Virtex 6 FPGA and 16.3 million samples per second for signatures with 179 slices on a Spartan 6 device.},

  abstract = {Lattice-based cryptography, one of the leading candidates for post-quantum security, relies heavily on discrete Gaussian samplers to provide necessary uncertainty, obfuscating computations on secret information. For reconfigurable hardware, the cumulative distribution table (CDT) scheme has previously been shown to achieve the highest throughput and the smallest resource utilisation, easily outperforming other existing samplers. However, the CDT sampler does not scale well. In fact, for large parameters, the lookup tables required are far too large to be practically implemented. This research proposes a hierarchy of multiple smaller samplers, extending the Gaussian convolution lemma to compute optimal parameters, where the individual samplers require much smaller lookup tables. A large range of parameter sets, covering encryption, signatures, and key exchange are evaluated. Hardware-optimised parameters are formulated and a practical implementation on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA device is realised. The proposed sampling designs demonstrate promising performance on reconfigurable hardware, even for large parameters, that were otherwise thought infeasible.},

  abstract = {The recent lattice-based signature scheme Dilithium, submitted as part of the CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) package, is one of a number of strong candidates submitted for the NIST standardisation process of post-quantum cryptography. The Dilithium signature scheme is based on the Fiat-Shamir paradigm and can be seen as a variant of the Bai-Galbraith scheme (BG) combined with several improvements from previous ancestor lattice-based schemes like GLP and BLISS signature schemes. One of the main features of Dilithium is the compressed public-key, which is a rounded version of the LWE instance. This implies that Dilithium is not breakable with the knowledge of only the secret or the error of the LWE instance, unlike its ancestor lattice-based signature schemes. In this paper, we investigate the security of Dilithium against a combination of side-channel and classical attacks. Side-channel attacks on schoolbook and optimised polynomial multiplication algorithms in the signing procedure are shown to extract the secret component of the LWE instance, which is just one among the multiple components of the secret-key of Dilithium. We then propose an alternative signing procedure, through which it is possible to forge signatures with only the extracted portion of the secret-key, without requiring the knowledge of all its elements. Thus showing that Dilithium too breaks on just knowing the secret portion of the LWE instance, similar to previous lattice-based schemes.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the security of the BLISS lattice-based signature scheme, one of the most promising candidates for postquantum-secure signatures, against side-channel attacks. Several works have been devoted to its efficient implementation on various platforms, from desktop CPUs to microcontrollers and FPGAs, and more recent papers have also considered its security against certain types of physical attacks, notably fault injection and cache attacks. We turn to more traditional side-channel analysis, and describe several attacks that can yield a full key recovery. We first identify a serious source of leakage in the rejection sampling algorithm used during signature generation. Existing implementations of that rejection sampling step, which is essential for security, actually leak the "relative norm" of the secret key. We show how an extension of an algorithm due to Howgrave-Graham and Szydlo can be used to recover the key from that relative norm, at least when the absolute norm is easy to factor (which happens for a significant fraction of secret keys). We describe how this leakage can be exploited in practice both on an embedded device (an 8-bit AVR microcontroller) using electromagnetic analysis (EMA), and a desktop computer (recent Intel CPU running Linux) using branch tracing. The latter attack has been mounted against the open source VPN software strongSwan. We also show that other parts of the BLISS signing algorithm can leak secrets not just for a subset of secret keys, but for 100\% of them. The BLISS Gaussian sampling algorithm in strongSwan is intrinsically variable time. This would be hard to exploit using a noisy source of leakage like EMA, but branch tracing allows to recover the entire randomness and hence the key: we show that a single execution of the strongSwan signature algorithm is actually sufficient for full key recovery. We also describe a more traditional side-channel attack on the sparse polynomial multiplications carried out in BLISS: classically, multiplications can be attacked using DPA; however, our target 8-bit AVR target implementation uses repeated shifted additions instead. Surprisingly, we manage to obtain a full key recovery in that setting using integer linear programming from a single EMA trace.},

As such, we can secure a ring-LWE implementation using additive masking with minimal changes.

  abstract = {We describe new arithmetic coding techniques and side-channel blinding countermeasures for lattice-based cryptography. Using these techniques, we develop a practical, compact, and more quantum-resistant variant of the BLISS Ideal Lattice Signature Scheme. We first show how the BLISS parameters and hash-based random oracle can be modified to be more secure against quantum pre-image attacks while optimizing signature size. Arithmetic Coding offers an information theoretically optimal compression for stationary and memoryless sources, such as the discrete Gaussian distributions often present in lattice-based cryptography. We show that this technique gives better signature sizes than the previously proposed advanced Huffman-based signature compressors. We further demonstrate that arithmetic decoding from an uniform source to target distribution is also an optimal non-uniform sampling method in the sense that a minimal amount of true random bits is required. Performance of this new Binary Arithmetic Coding sampler is comparable to other practical samplers. The same code, tables, or circuitry can be utilized for both tasks, eliminating the need for separate sampling and compression components. We then describe simple randomized blinding techniques that can be applied to anti-cyclic polynomial multiplication to mask timing- and power consumption side-channels in ring arithmetic. We further show that the Gaussian sampling process can also be blinded by a split-and-permute techniques as an effective countermeasure against side-channel attacks.},

The modular arithmetic is important for a wide variety of computations in these devices, from communication to signal processing.

Our goal is to use the resources of a crypto-coprocessor to accelerate general modular operations. The paper describes our implementation of modular arithmetic operations with large integers, and provides the comparison of the accelerated method with three classical methods for (modular) multiplication. The standard methods are represented by the operand-scanning multiplication algorithm (the school-book method), the product-scanning method (Comba's method) and the Montgomery multiplication. The accelerated method is based on using the RSA encryption support for multiplication tunnelling.

  abstract = {We analyze the security of three-share hardware implementations against differential power analysis and advanced variants such as mutual information analysis. We present dedicated distinguishers that allow to recover secret key bits from any cryptographic primitive that is implemented as a sequence of quadratic functions. Starting from the analytical treatment of such distinguishers and information-theoretic arguments, we derive the success probability and required number of traces in the presence of algorithmic noise. We show that attacks on three-share hardware implementation require a number of traces that scales in the third power of the algorithmic noise variance. Finally, we apply and test our model on KECCAK in a keyed mode.},

  abstract = {The Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) provides efficient algorithms for cyclic and nega-cyclic convolutions, which have many applications in computer arithmetic, e.g., for multiplying large integers and large degree polynomials. It is commonly used in cryptographic schemes that are based on the hardness of the Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem to efficiently implement modular polynomial multiplication.

We present a new modular reduction technique that is tailored for the special moduli required by the NTT. Based on this reduction, we speed up the NTT and propose faster, multi-purpose algorithms. We present two implementations of these algorithms: a portable C implementation and a high-speed implementation using assembly with AVX2 instructions. To demonstrate the improved efficiency in an application example, we benchmarked the algorithms in the context of the R-LWE key exchange protocol that has recently been proposed by Alkim, Ducas, Pöppelmann and Schwabe. In this case, our C and assembly implementations compute the full key exchange 1.49 and 1.13 times faster, respectively. These results are achieved with full protection against timing attacks.},

  abstract = {There exists a broad range of RFID protocols in literature that propose hash functions as cryptographic primitives. Since Keccak has been selected as the winner of the NIST SHA-3 competition in 2012, there is the question of how far we can push the limits of Keccak to fulﬁll the stringent requirements of passive low-cost RFID. In this paper, we address this question by presenting a hardware implementation of Keccak that aims for lowest power and lowest area. Our smallest (fullstate) design requires only 2 927 GEs (for designs with external memory available) and 5 522 GEs (total size including memory). It has a power consumption of 12.5 µW at 1 MHz on a low leakage 130 nm CMOS process technology. As a result, we provide a design that needs 40 \% less resources than related work. Our design is even smaller than the smallest SHA-1 and SHA-2 implementations.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of dividing a two-word integer by a single-word integer, together with a few extensions and applications. Due to lack of efﬁcient division instructions in current processors, the division is performed as a multiplication using a precomputed single-word approximation of the reciprocal of the divisor, followed by a couple of adjustment steps. There are three common types of unsigned multiplication instructions; we deﬁne full word multiplication (umul) which produces the two-word product of two single-word integers, low multiplication (umullo) which produces only the least signiﬁcant word of the product, and high multiplication (umulhi), which produces only the most signiﬁcant word. We describe an algorithm which produces a quotient and remainder using one umul and one umullo. This is an improvement over earlier methods, since the new method uses cheaper multiplication operations. It turns out we also get some additional savings from simpler adjustment conditions. The algorithm has been implemented in version 4.3 of the GMP library. When applied to the problem of dividing a large integer by a single word, the new algorithm gives a speedup of roughly 30\%, benchmarked on AMD and Intel processors in the x86 64 family.},
