\chapter{Introduction and Motivation}

Cryptography lays a foundation for many aspects of modern society, including monetary 
transactions, electronic commerce, and private communications. Public Key cryptography
 schemes have taken a crucial role in safeguarding our information and with the 
 proliferation of IoT devices, their presence is becoming even more wide-spread. \\


Quantum Computers are getting closer to a reality and so is the threat they would pose
 to to the security of currently deployed Public Key cryptography schemes. As formulated
  by Shor’s algorithm, quantum computers would be able to solve “integer factorization”
   and “discrete logarithm” problems, the underlying hard problems for RSA and ECC 
   schemes, in a polynomial time complexity. \\


Public Key cryptography schemes which can withstand the power of Quantum Computers
 are being considered and evaluated worldwide. The National Institute of Standards and 
 Technology (NIST) has organized a project for evaluating and standardizing Post-Quantum
  Cryptography schemes. During the first round, 23 signature schemes were submitted, 59
   encryption/KEM schemes were submitted, of which 69 total were deemed complete and
    proper. Among the encryption/KEM schemes, those based on Lattices are deemed 
    promising as they appear to provide a high level of security, with good performance
     and smaller key size. 


Kyber.PKE\cite{bos2018} is a Public Key Encryption scheme, developed as a part of Crystal Kyber KEM, 
and is one of the most promising candidates among NIST Round 1 PKE and KEM submissions.
 It’s based on Module Learning With Error (M-LWR) problem and by itself is deemed to have
  the Indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) property. The Public
   Key Encryption scheme is composed of three basic primitives: Key generation, 
   Encryption, and Decryption. The Kyber.PKE submission to NIST includes full
    specifications and a reference C implementation 
    \cite{kyberres}. High-level data-flow diagrams of
     the encryption and decryption primitives are provided in Fig \ref{fig:kyper_enc} and \ref{fig:kyper_dec}.

This project aims to design and develop an FPGA implementation of Kyper.PKE optimized 
for area and resource usage. Resilience of the implementation agains timing and power
 attacks is also a primary design consideration. At the time of this writing, no other
  published hardware implementations of Kyber seems yet to be available.

  \chapter{Design Entry}
  The design will be implemented in VHDL 2008 hardware description language. Kyber.PKE 
  will be implemented as distinct entities: Encryption, Decryption, and Key Generation.
   The design will follow best coding practices for code readability and will target a 
   modular design with as much code reuse as possible. Every building block will have 
   it’s own verification test-bench (through CocoTB) and the completed 3 entities will 
   as well be verified against the reference implementation.


The primary target platform is Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA SoCs. The developed design will be
 tested on a MYIR Z-turn development board which hosts a Zynq-7020 chip. Developed design
  will be programmed into Zynq’s Programmable Logic (PL) FPGA fabric and accessed through 
  an AMBA-AXI4 interface by Linux application running on the ARM processors (PS). 
  Simulations for verification will be primarily done using GHDL free/open-source VHDL
   simulator.  FPGA synthesis is performed using Vivado. The Integrated Design Environment
    of choice for the VHDL development is Sigasi Studio.


\chapter{Verification}
Ensuring the correct functionality of the implementation is a primary concern during the 
development. The design will be developed in a modular fashion accompanying unit-tests 
and integration tests. Functional verification is performed against the reference 
software implementation using Python, Cocotb \cite{cocotb}
 , and GHDL \cite{ghdl}.

 \chapter{Use of other code}

 Bits and pieces from PoC library \cite{poc} as well as other available open-source libraries could be utilized for the design. 


A survey of hardware implementation of the required building blocks is under way. Ideas and code will be borrowed from previously published implementations and improved upon 
 for the purpose of this project.


 \chapter{Assumptions}

 The design goals in descending priority:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Area/Resources: measured as the number of used LUT, FF, DSP, and BRAM blocks used as reported by the synthesis tool.
     \item Resilience to Timing Attacks: constant timing
     \item Resilience to Simple Power Attacks
     \item Efficiency: least number of cycles and highest attainable frequency considering all above constraints.  
 \end{itemize}

 \chapter{Circuit Interface}
 The interface of the three main entities (Encryption, Decryption, Key Generation) will 
 be AMBA AXI-Lite which will be accessed both during simulations by CocoTB+GHDL/VCS and 
 in the FPGA instance by the Linux application running on ARM cores.
